<p>The following have the ordinary English sounds: b, d, h, k, l, m, n,
p, r, s, t, w, y, and z. A superior n (<sup>n</sup>) after a vowel nasalizes it. A
plus sign (+) after any letter prolongs it.</p>

<p>With the exception of the five letters taken from Riggs' Dakota Dictionary,
and used only in the Dakota words in this paper, the above
letters belong to the alphabet adopted by the Bureau of Ethnology.

<small>INTRODUCTION.</small></h2>

<p id="s1">§ 1. The Omaha Indians belong to the ₵egiha group of the Siouan
family. The ₵egiha group may be divided into the Omaha-₵egiha and
the Kwapa-₵egiha. In the former are four tribes, speaking three dialects,
while the latter consists of one tribe, the Kwapas. The dialects
are as follows: Pañka, spoken by the Ponkas and Omahas; Waᴐaᴐe,
the Osage dialect; [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze, that of the Kansas or Kaws, closely related
to the Waᴐaᴐe; and Ugaqpa, or Kwapa.</p>

<p id="s2">§ 2. ₵egiha means, "Belonging to the people of this land," and answers
to the Oto "[T]ᴐiwere," and the Iowa "[T]ᴐeʞiwere." Mr. Joseph La
Flèche, who was formerly a head chief of the Omahas, also said that
₵egiha was about equivalent to "Dakota." When an Omaha was challenged
in the dark, when on his own land, he generally replied, "I am
a ₵egiha." So did a Ponka reply, under similar circumstances, when
on his own land. But when challenged in the dark, when away from
home, he was obliged to give the name of his tribe, saying, "I am an
Omaha," or, "I am a Ponka," as the case might be.</p>

<p id="s3">§ 3. The real name of the Omahas is "Uma<sup>n</sup>ha<sup>n</sup>." It is explained by
a tradition obtained from a few members of the tribe. When the ancestors
of the Omahas, Ponkas, Osages, and several other cognate tribes
traveled down the Ohio to its mouth, they separated on reaching the
Mississippi. Some went up the river, hence the name Uma<sup>n</sup>ha<sup>n</sup>, from
ʞíma<sup>n</sup>ha<sup>n</sup>, "to go against the wind or stream." The rest went down
the river, hence the name Ugáqpa or Kwápa, from ugáqpa or ugáha, "to
float down the stream."</p>

<h3 id="EARLY_MIGRATIONS_OF_THE_CEGIHA_TRIBES">EARLY MIGRATIONS OF THE ₵EGIHA TRIBES.</h3>

<p>The tribes that went up the Mississippi were the Omahas, Ponkas,
Osages, and Kansas. Some of the Omahas remember a tradition that
their ancestors once dwelt at the place where Saint Louis now stands;
and the Osages and Kansas say that they were all one people, inhabiting
an extensive peninsula, on the Missouri River.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

<p>On this peninsula was a high mountain, which the Kansas called
Ma<sup>n</sup>-daqpaye and Tce-dŭñga-ajabe; the corresponding Osage name being
Ma<sup>n</sup>-ʇaqpa¢ě.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Subsequently, these tribes ranged through a territory, including
Osage, Gasconade, and other adjacent counties of the State of Missouri,
perhaps most of the country lying between the Mississippi and the
Osage Rivers. The Iowas were near them; but the Omahas say that
the Otos and Missouris were not known to them. The Iowa chiefs,
however, have a tradition that the Otos were their kindred, and that
both tribes, as well as the Omahas and Ponkas, were originally Winnebagos.
A recent study of the dialects of the Osages, Kansas, and
Kwapas discloses remarkable similarities which strengthen the supposition
that the Iowas and Otos, as well as the Missouris, were of one stock.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the Osage River the final separation occurred. The
Omahas and Ponkas crossed the Missouri and, accompanied by the
Iowas, proceeded by degrees through Missouri, Iowa, and Minnesota,
till they reached the neighborhood of the Red Pipestone quarry. This
must have taken many years, as their course was marked by a succession
of villages, consisting of earth lodges.</p>

<p>Thence they journeyed towards the Big Sioux River, where they made
a fort. They remained in that country a long time, making earth lodges
and cultivating fields. Game abounded. At that time the Yanktons
dwelt in a densely wooded country near the head of the Mississippi;
hence the Omahas called them, in those days, "Ja<sup>n</sup>´aʇa ni´kaci<sup>n</sup>ga, The
people who dwelt in the woods." After that the Yanktons removed and
became known as Yanktons. By and by the Dakotas made war on the
three tribes, and many Omahas were killed by them. So at last the
three tribes went west and southwest to a lake near the head of Choteau
Creek, Dakota Territory, now known as Lake Andes (?). There they cut
the sacred pole (see §§ <a href="#s36">36</a> and <a href="#s153">153</a>), and assigned to each gens and subgens
its peculiar customs, such as the sacred pipe, sacred tents, and the taboos.
There were a great many gentes in each tribe at that time, far more than
they have at present; and these gentes were in existence long before
they cut the sacred pole.</p>

<p>After leaving the lake, known as "Waq¢éxe gasai´ ¢a<sup>n</sup>, Where they
cut the sacred pole," they traveled up the Missouri River till they arrived
at Ni-úgacúde, White Earth River. They crossed the Missouri,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
above this stream, and occupied the country between the Missouri and
the Black Hills, though they did not go to the Black Hills.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> After
awhile, they turned down stream, and kept together till they reached
the mouth of the Niobrara, where the Ponkas stopped. The Omahas
and Iowas continued their journey till they reached Bow Creek, Nebraska,
where the Omahas made their village, the Iowas going beyond
till they reached Ionia Creek, where they made a village on the east
bank of the stream, near its mouth, and not far from the site of the present
town of Ponca.</p>

<p>By and by the Omahas removed to a place near Covington, Nebr.,
nearly opposite the present Sioux City. The remains of this village are
now known as "[T]i-ʇañ´ga-jiñ´ga," and the lake near by is called "₵íxucpa<sup>n</sup>-úg¢e,"
because of the willow trees found along its banks.</p>

<p>In the course of time the Iowas passed the Omahas again, and made
a new village near the place where Florence now stands. After that
they continued their course southward to their present reservation.</p>

<p>The Otos did not accompany the Ponkas, Omahas, and Iowas, when
they crossed the Missouri, and left the Osages and others. The Otos
were first met on the Platte River, in comparatively modern times, according
to Mr. La Flèche.</p>

<p>9. Then on the Elkhorn, near Wisner, for ten years. While there,
A<sup>n</sup>ba-hebe married.</p>

<p>10. About the year 1832-'3, they returned to Ta<sup>n</sup>wa<sup>n</sup>-ʇañga, on Omaha
Creek.</p>

<p>11. In 1841 they went to Ta<sup>n</sup>´wa<sup>n</sup>-jiñgá ¢a<sup>n</sup>, The Little Village, at the
mouth of Logan Creek, and on the east side.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>

<p>12. In 1843, they returned to Ta<sup>n</sup>wa<sup>n</sup>-ʇañga.</p>

<p>13. In 1845 they went to a plateau west of Bellevue. On the top of
the plateau they built their earth lodges, while the agency was at Bellevue.</p>

<p>14. They removed to their present reserve in 1855.</p>

<h3 id="PRESENT_STATE_OF_THE_OMAHAS">PRESENT STATE OF THE OMAHAS.</h3>

<p id="s5">§ 5. Their reservation was about 30 miles in extent from east to west,
and 18 or 20 from north to south. It formed Black Bird County. The
northern part of it containing some of the best of the timber lands, was
ceded to the Winnebagos, when that tribe was settled in Nebraska, and
is now in Dakota County. The southern part, the present Omaha reservation,
is in Burt County. The Omahas have not decreased in population
during the past twenty-five years. In 1876 they numbered 1,076.
In 1882 there are about 1,100. Most of the men have been farmers
since 1869; but some of them, under Mr. La Flèche, began to work for
themselves as far back as 1855. Each man resides on his claim, for
which he holds a patent given him by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Many live in frame houses, the most of which were built at the expense
of their occupants.

<small>THE STATE.</small></h2>

<p id="s6">§ 6. "A state," said Maj. J. W. Powell, in his presidential address to
the Anthropological Society of Washington, in 1882, "is a body politic,
an organized group of men with an established government, and a
body of determined law. In the organization of societies units of different
orders are discovered." Among the Omahas and other tribes of
the Siouan family, the primary unit is the gens or clan, which is composed
of a number of consanguinei, claiming descent from a common ancestor,
and having a common taboo or taboos. But starting from the
tribe or state as a whole, we find among the Omahas two half-tribes of
five gentes each, the first called "Hañga-cenu," and the second, "Ictasanda."
(See § <a href="#s10">10</a>.) These half-tribes do not seem to be phratries, as
they do not possess the rights of the latter as stated by Morgan: the
Hañga-cenu gentes never meet by themselves apart from the Ictasanda
gentes.</p>

<p>Next to the half-tribes are the gentes, of which the Omahas have ten.
Each gens in turn is divided into "uʞig¢a[s]ne," or subgentes. The
number of the latter varies, at present, according to the particular
gens; though the writer has found traces of the existence of four subgentes
in each gens in former days. The subgentes seem to be composed
of a number of groups of a still lower order, which are provisionally
termed "sections." The existence of sections among the Omahas
had been disputed by some, though other members of the tribe claim
that they are real units of the lowest order. We find among the Tito<sup>n</sup>-wa<sup>n</sup>
Dakotas, many of these groups, which were originally sections, but
which have at length become gentes, as the marriage laws do not affect
the higher groups, the original phratries, gentes, and subgentes.</p>

<p>The Ponka chiefs who were in Washington in 1880, claimed that in
their tribe there used to be eight gentes, one of which has become
extinct; and that now there are ten, three subgentes having become
gentes in recent times. According to Mr. Joseph La Flèche, a Ponka by
birth, who spent his boyhood with the tribe, there are but seven gentes,
one having become extinct; while the Wajaje and Nuqe, which are now
the sixth and seventh gentes, were originally one. For a fuller discussion
of the gentes see the next chapter.</p>

<p>The state, as existing among the Omahas and cognate tribes, may be
termed a kinship state, that is, one in which "governmental functions
are performed by men whose positions in the government are determined
by kinship, and rules relating to kinship and the reproduction of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
the species constitute the larger body of the law. The law regulates
marriage and the rights and duties of the several members of a body of
kindred to each other. Individuals are held responsible," chiefly "to
their kindred; and certain groups of kindred are held responsible," in
some cases, "to other groups of kindred. When other conduct, such as
the distribution of game taken from the forest or fish from the sea, is regulated,
the rules or laws pertaining thereto involve the considerations
of kinship," to a certain extent. (See Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">XII</a>, § <a href="#s303">303</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="DIFFERENTIATION_OF_ORGANS_IN_THE_STATE">DIFFERENTIATION OF ORGANS IN THE STATE.</h3>

<p id="s7">§ 7. The legislative, executive, and judicial functions have not been
differentiated. (See Government, Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">XI</a>.)</p>

<p>Whether the second mode of differentiation has taken place among
the Omahas, and just in the order described by Major Powell, is an open
question. This mode is thus stated: "Second, by the multiplication
of the orders of units and the specialization of the subordinate units so
that subordinate organizations perform special functions. Thus cities
may be divided into wards, counties into towns." Subgentes, as well
as gentes, were necessary among the Omahas for marriage purposes, as
is shown in §§ <a href="#s57">57</a>, <a href="#s78">78</a>, etc. The recent tendency has been to centralization
or consolidation, whereas there are strong reasons for believing that
each gens had four subgentes at the first; several subgentes having
become few in number of persons have been united to the remaining
and more powerful subgentes of their respective gentes.</p>

<p>The third mode of differentiations of organs in the State is "by multiplication
of corporations for specific purposes." The writer has not
yet been able to find any traces of this mode among the Omahas and
cognate tribes.</p>

<p id="s8">§ 8. Two classes of organization are found in the constitution of the
State, "those relating directly to the government, called major organizations,
and those relating indirectly to the government, called minor
organizations." The former embraces the State classes, the latter, corporations.</p>

<h3 id="STATE_CLASSES">STATE CLASSES.</h3>

<p>These have not been clearly differentiated. Three classes of men have
been recognized: Níkagáhi, wanáce, and cénujiñ´ga.</p>

<p>In civil affairs, the nikagahi are the chiefs, exercising legislative, executive,
and judicial functions. They alone have a voice in the tribal
assembly, which is composed of them. The wanace, policemen, or braves,
are the servants or messengers of the chiefs, and during the surrounding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
of a herd of buffalo, they have extraordinary powers conferred on
them. (See §§ <a href="#s140">140</a> and <a href="#s297">297</a>.)</p>

<p>The cenujiñga, or young men, are the "common people," such as have
not distinguished themselves, either in war or in any other way. They
have no voice in the assembly, and during the buffalo hunt they must
obey the chiefs and wanace.</p>

<p>In religious affairs, which are closely associated with civil ones, we
find the chiefs having a prominent part. Besides the chiefs proper are
the seven keepers of the sacred pipes, or pipes of peace (see §§ <a href="#s14">14</a>-<a href="#s19">19</a>,
<a href="#s287">287</a>, <a href="#s296">296</a>), and the keepers of the three sacred tents (see §§ <a href="#s13">13</a>, <a href="#s22">22</a>-<a href="#s24">24</a>,
<a href="#s36">36</a>, <a href="#s295">295</a>). The functions of these keepers of the sacred tents, especially
those of the two Hañga men, appear to be both religious and civil. Of
these two men, [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ said: "The two old men, Waka<sup>n</sup>´-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>
and [T]e-ha<sup>n</sup>´ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>, are the real governors of the tribe, and are counted
as gods. They are reverenced by all, and men frequently give them
presents. They mark the tattooed women." Frank La Flèche denied
this, saying that these two old men are the servants of the Hañga chief,
being only the keepers of the sacred tents of his gens. J. La Flèche
and Two Crows said that while there were some "níkaci<sup>n</sup>´ga qubé,"
sacred or mysterious men, among the Omahas, they did not know who
they were. Some of the chiefs and people respect them, but others
despise them. It is probable that by níkaci<sup>n</sup>´ga qube, they meant exorcists
or conjurers, rather than priests, as the former pretend to be
"qube," mysterious, and to have supernatural communications.</p>

<p>There is no military class or gens among the Omahas, though the
Ponka ₵ixida gens, and part of the Nika[p]aᴐna gens are said to be warriors.
Among the Omahas, both the captains and warriors must be taken
from the class of cenujiñga, as the chiefs are afraid to undertake the work
of the captains. The chiefs, being the civil and religious leaders of the
people, cannot serve as captains or even as subordinate officers of a war
party. Nor can they join such a party unless it be a large one. Their
influence is exerted on the side of peace (see §§ <a href="#s191">191</a>, <a href="#s292">292</a>), and they try
to save the lives of murderers. (See § <a href="#s310">310</a>.) They conduct peace negotiations
between contending tribes. (See §§ <a href="#s220">220</a>, <a href="#s292">292</a>.)</p>

<p>All the members of a war party, including the captains, lieutenants,
and wanace, as well the warriors, are promoted to the grade or class of
(civil) wanace on their return from battle. (See § <a href="#s216">216</a>.)</p>

<h4 id="SERVANTS">SERVANTS.</h4>

<p>There are no slaves; but there are several kinds of servants called
wagáq¢a<sup>n</sup>. In civil and religious affairs, the following are wagáq¢a<sup>n</sup>.
The two keepers of the Hañga sacred tents are the servants of the
Hañga chief. (See above, § <a href="#s295">295</a>, etc.) One of these old men is always
the servant of the other though they exchange places. (See § <a href="#s151">151</a>.)
The keepers of the sacred pipes are the servants of the chiefs. (See §§
<a href="#s17">17</a>-<a href="#s19">19</a>). The ₵atada Quʞa man is the servant of the keepers of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
sacred tents. (See § <a href="#s143">143</a>.) Some of the Wasabe-hit`ajĭ men are servants
of the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte gens, acting as such in the sacred tent. (See §§
<a href="#s23">23</a>, <a href="#s24">24</a>.) Some of the Iñke-sabě men are the servants of the Hañga
when they act as criers (see §§ <a href="#s130">130</a>, <a href="#s136">136</a>, etc.), and so is a [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze man
(§ <a href="#s152">152</a>). The wanace are the servants of the chiefs. The wag¢a or
messengers acting as criers for a feast are the servants of the giver of
the feast for the time being.</p>

<p>In military affairs, the following are servants: The men who act as
wag¢a for the preliminary feast; the men who carry the baggage of
the captains and wait on them; the bearer of the kettle; the bearers of
the sacred bags when there is a large party; the special followers of
each captain, including his lieutenant, the followers or warriors being
about equally divided between the captains; and the wanace or policemen.
(See War Customs, Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">IX</a>.)</p>

<p>Social classes are undifferentiated. Any man can win a name and
rank in the state by becoming "wacuce," or brave, either in war or by
the bestowal of gifts and the frequent giving of feasts. (See § <a href="#s224">224</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="CORPORATIONS">CORPORATIONS.</h3>

<p>Corporations are minor organizations, which are indirectly related to
the government, though they do not constitute a part of it.</p>

<p>The Omahas are organized into certain societies for religious, industrial,
and other ends. There are two kinds, the Ikágekí¢ě or brother-hoods,
and the Úkikune¢ě, or feasting organizations. The former are
the dancing societies, to some of which the doctors belong. A fuller
description of them will be found in Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_X">X</a>.</p>

<p>The industrial organization of the state will be discussed in Chapters
<a href="#CHAPTER_VII">VII</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">VIII</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">IX</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_X">X</a>, and <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">XI</a>.

<small>THE GENTILE SYSTEM.</small></h2>

<h3 id="TRIBAL_CIRCLES">TRIBAL CIRCLES.</h3>

<p id="s9">§ 9. In former days, whenever a large camping-ground could not be
found, the Ponkas used to encamp in three concentric circles; while the
Omahas, who were a smaller tribe, pitched their tents in two similar
circles. This custom gave rise to the name "Oyate yamni," The Three
Nations, as the Ponkas were styled by the Dakotas, and the Omahas
became known as the Two Nations. But the usual order of encampment
has been to pitch all the tents in one large circle or horseshoe,
called "hú¢uga" by the Indians. In this circle the gentes took their
regular places, disregarding their gentile circles, and pitching the tents,
one after another, within the area necessary for each gens. This circle
was not made by measurement, nor did any one give directions where
each tent should be placed; that was left to the women.</p>

<p>When the people built a village of earth-lodges, and dwelt in it, they
did not observe this order of camping. Each man caused his lodge to
be built wherever he wished to have it, generally near those of his kindred.
But whenever the whole tribe migrated with the skin tents, as
when they went after the buffaloes, they observed this order. (See
§ <a href="#s133">133</a>.)</p>

<p>Sometimes the tribe divided into two parties, some going in one direction,
some in another. On such occasions the regular order of camping
was not observed; each man encamped near his kindred, whether
they were maternal or paternal consanguinities.</p>

<p>The crier used to tell the people to what place they were to go, and
when they reached it the women began to pitch the tents.</p>

<h3 id="THE_OMAHA_TRIBAL_CIRCLE">THE OMAHA TRIBAL CIRCLE.</h3>

<p id="s10">§ 10. The road along which they passed divided the tribal circle into
two equal parts; five gentes camped on the right of it and five pitched
their tents on its left. Those on the right were called the Hañgacenu,
and the others were known as the Ictasanda. The Hañgacenu gentes
are as follows: Wéji<sup>n</sup>cte, Iñké-sábě, Hañ´ga, ₵átada, and [K]a<sup>n</sup>´ze. The
Ictasanda gentes are as follows: Ma<sup>n</sup>`¢iñka-gáxe, [T]e-sĭn´de, [T]a-[p]á,
Iñg¢é-jide, and Ictásanda.</p>

<p>According to Waha<sup>n</sup>-¢iñge, the chief of the [T]e-sĭnde gens, there used
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
to be one hundred and thirty-three tents pitched by the Hañgacenu,
and one hundred and forty-seven by the Ictasanda. This was probably
the case when they went on the hunt the last time, in 1871 or 1872.</p>

<p>The sacred tents of the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte and Hañga gentes are designated by appropriate figures; so also
are the seven gentes which keep the sacred pipes. The diameter of the circle represents the road
traveled by the tribe, A and K forming the gentes in the van.]</p>

<h4 id="RULES_FOR_PITCHING_THE_TENTS">RULES FOR PITCHING THE TENTS.</h4>

<p id="s11">§ 11. Though they did not measure the distances, each woman knew
where to pitch her tent. Thus a [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze woman who saw a Weji<sup>n</sup>cte tent set
up, knew that her tent must be pitched at a certain distance from that part
of the circle, and at or near the opposite end of the road or diameter of
the circle. When two tents were pitched too far apart one woman said
to the other, "Pitch the tent a little closer." Or, if they were too close,
she said, "Pitch the tent further away." So also if the tents of neighboring
gentes were too far apart or too close together. In the first case
the women of one gens might say, "Move along a little, and give us
more room." In the other they might say, "Come back a little, as there
is too much space between us." When the end gentes, Weji<sup>n</sup>cte and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
Ictasanda, were too far apart there was sometimes danger of attacks of
enemies. On one occasion the Dakotas made a dash into the very midst
of the circle and did much damage, because the space between these
two gentes was too great. But at other times, when there is no fear of
an attack, and when the women wish to dress hides, etc., the crier said:
"Halloo! Make ye them over a large tract of land." This is the only
occasion when the command is given <i>how</i> to pitch the tents.</p>

<p>When the tribe returned from the hunt the gentes encamped in reverse
order, the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte and Ictasanda gentes having their tents at
the end of the circle nearest home.</p>

<p>There appear indications that there were special areas, not only for
the gentes, but even for the subgentes, all members of any subgens
having their lodges set up in the same area. Thus, in the Iñke-sabě
gens, there are some that camped next the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte, and others next
the Hañga; some of the Hañga camped next the Iñke-sabě, and others
next the ₵atada, and so on. (See § <a href="#s73">73</a>.)</p>

<p id="s12">§ 12. Within the circle were placed the horses, as a precaution against
attacks from enemies. When a man had many horses and wished to
have them near him, he generally camped within the circle, apart from
his gens, but this custom was of modern origin, and was the exception
to the rule.</p>

<h3 id="THE_SACRED_TENTS">THE SACRED TENTS.</h3>

<p id="s13">§ 13. The three sacred tents were pitched within the circle and near
their respective gentes: that of the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte is the war tent, and it was
placed not more than 50 yards from its gens; those of the Hañga gens
are connected with the regulation of the buffalo hunt, etc.; or, we may
say that the former had to do with the protection of life and the latter
with the sustenance of life, as they used to depend mainly on the hunt
for food, clothing, and means of shelter.</p>

<h3 id="THE_SACRED_PIPES">THE SACRED PIPES.</h3>

<p id="s14">§ 14. All the sacred pipes belong to the Hañga gens, though Hañga,
in ancient times, appointed the Iñke-sabě gens as the custodian of
them. (J. La Flèche and Two Crows.) The Iñke-sabě gens, however,
claims through its chief, Gahige, to have been the first owner of the
pipes; but this is doubtful. There are at present but two sacred
pipes in existence among the Omahas, though there are seven gentes
which are said to possess sacred pipes. These seven are as follows:
Three of the Hañgacenu, the Iñke-sabě, ₵atada, and [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze, and four
of the Ictasanda, the Ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka-gaxe, [T]e-sĭnde, [T]a-[p]a, and Ictasanda.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
The two sacred pipes still in existence are kept by the Iñke-sabě gens.
These pipes are called "Niniba waqube," Sacred Pipes, or "Niniba
jide," Red Pipes. They are made of the red pipestone which is found
in the famous red pipestone quarry. The stems are nearly flat and are
worked near the mouth-piece with porcupine quills.</p>

<h4 id="GAHIGES_ACCOUNT_OF_THE_TRADITION_OF_THE_PIPES">GAHIGE'S ACCOUNT OF THE TRADITION OF THE PIPES.</h4>

<p id="s15">§ 15. Gahige, of the Iñke-sabě gens, said that his gens had the seven
pipes at the first, and caused them to be distributed among the other
gentes. He named as the seven gentes who had the pipes, the following:
1. Iñke-sabě; 2. [T]e-[p]a-it`ajĭ sub-gens of the ₵atada; 3. Ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka-gaxe;
4. [T]a-[p]a; 5. [T]e-sĭnde; 6. Ictasanda; 7. Hañga (<i>sic</i>). In order
to reach the Hañga again the seven old men had to go partly around
the circle a second time. These are the gentes that had pipes and
chiefs at the first. The chiefs of the three remaining gentes, the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte,
[K]a<sup>n</sup>ze, and Iñg¢e-jide, were not made for years afterward. He
also said that the buffalo skull given to the [T]e-[p]a-it`ajĭ was regarded as
equivalent to a sacred pipe.</p>

<p>The writer is inclined to think that there is some truth in what Gahige
has said, though he cannot accept all of his statement. Gahige gives
one pipe to the Hañga gens; Two Crows intimated that his gens was
the virtual keeper of a pipe. But A<sup>n</sup>ba-hebe's story shows that it was
not a real pipe, but the firebrand for lighting the pipes. In like manner,
[T]e-[p]a-it`ajĭ has not a real pipe, but the buffalo skull, which is considered
as a pipe. Hence, it may be that the men who are called
"keepers of the pipes" in the [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze, Ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka-gaxe, [T]a-[p]a, [T]e-sĭnde,
and Ictasanda gentes never had real pipes but certain objects which
are held sacred, and have some connection with the two pipes kept by
the Iñke-sabě.</p>

<h4 id="AN-BA-HEBES_ACCOUNT_OF_THE_SAME">A<sup>n</sup>BA-HEBE'S ACCOUNT OF THE TRADITION OF THE PIPES.</h4>

<p id="s16">§ 16. The following is the tradition of the sacred pipes, according to
A<sup>n</sup>ba-hebe, the aged historian of the Omahas:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The old men made seven pipes and carried them around the tribal circle. They
first reached Weji<sup>n</sup>cte, who sat there as a male elk, and was frightful to behold, so
the old men did not give him a pipe. Passing on to the Iñke-sabě, they gave the first
pipe to the head of that gens. Next they came to Hañga, to whom they handed a
firebrand, saying, "Do thou keep the firebrand," <i>i. e.</i>, "You are to thrust it into the
pipe-bowls." Therefore it is the duty of Hañga to light the pipes for the chiefs (<i>sic</i>).
When they reached the Bear people they feared them because they sat there with the
sacred bag of black bear-skin, so they did not give them a pipe. The Blackbird people
received no pipe because they sat with the sacred bag of bird-skins and feathers.
And the old men feared the Turtle people, who had made a big turtle on the ground,
so they passed them by. But when they saw the Eagle people they gave them a
pipe because they did not fear them, and the buffalo was good. (Others say that the
Eagle people had started off in anger when they found themselves slighted, but the
old men pursued them, and on overtaking them they handed them a bladder filled with
tobacco, and also a buffalo skull, saying, "Keep this skull as a sacred thing." This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
appeased them, and they rejoined the tribe.) Next the old men saw the [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze, part
of whom were good, and part were bad. To the good ones they gave a pipe. The
Ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka-gaxe people were the next gens. They, too, were divided, half being bad.
These bad ones had some stones at the front of their lodge, and they colored these
stones, as well as their hair, orange-red. They wore plumes (hi<sup>n</sup>qpe) in their hair
(and a branch of cedar wrapped around their heads.&mdash;La Flèche), and were awful
to behold. So the old men passed on to the good ones, to whom they gave the
fourth pipe. Then they reached the [T]e-sĭnde, half of whom made sacred a buffalo,
and are known as those who eat not the lowest rib. Half of these were good, and they
received the fifth pipe. All of the [T]a-[p]a (A<sup>n</sup>ba-hebe's own gens!) were good, and they
obtained the sixth pipe. The Iñg¢e-jide took one whole side of a buffalo, and stuck
it up, leaving the red body but partially buried in the ground, after making a tent
of the skin. They who carried the pipes around were afraid of them, so they did not
give them one. Last of all they came to the Ictasanda. These people were disobedient,
destitute of food, and averse to staying long in one place. As the men who had
the pipes wished to stop this, they gave the seventh pipe to the fourth subgens of the
Ictasanda, and since then the members of this gens have behaved themselves.</p></blockquote>

<p>J. La Flèche and Two Crows say that "Weji<sup>n</sup>cte loved his waqube,
the miʞasi, or coyote, and so he did not wish a pipe" which pertained to
peace. "Hañga does not light the pipes for the chiefs", that is, he does
not <i>always</i> light the pipes.</p>

<p id="s17">§ 17. The true division of labor appears to be as follows: Hañga was
the source of the sacred pipes, and has a right to all, as that gens had
the first authority. Hañga is therefore called "I¢ig¢a<sup>n</sup>´qti aké,"  as he
does what he pleases with the pipes. Hañga told Íñke-sabě to carry
the pipes around the tribal circle; so that is why the seven old men did
so. And as Hañga directed it to be done, Iñke-sabě is called "A¢i<sup>n</sup>´ aké,"
The Keeper. Ictasanda fills the pipes. When the Ictasanda man who
attends to this duty does not come to the council the pipes cannot be
smoked, as no one else can fill them. This man, who knows the ritual,
sends all the others out of the lodge, as they must not hear the ancient
words. He utters some words when he cleans out the pipe-bowl, others
when he fills the pipe, etc. He does not always require the same amount
of time to perform this duty. Then all return to the lodge. Hañga, or
rather a member of that gens, lights the pipes, except at the time of the
greasing of the sacred pole, when he, not Ictasanda, fills the pipes, and
some one else lights them for him. (See § <a href="#s152">152</a>.) These three gentes,
Hañga, Iñke-sabě, and Ictasanda, are the only rulers among the keepers
of the sacred pipes. The other keepers are inferior; though said to
be keepers of sacred pipes, the pipes are not manifest.</p>

<p>These seven niniba waqube are peace pipes, but the niniba waqube of
the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte is the war pipe.</p>

<p id="s18">§ 18. The two sacred pipes kept by Iñke-sabě are used on various ceremonial
occasions. When the chiefs assemble and wish to make a decision
for the regulation of tribal affairs, Ictasanda fills both pipes and
lays them down before the two head chiefs. Then the Iñke-sabě keeper
takes one and the [T]e-[p]a it`ajĭ keeper the other. Iñke-sabě precedes,
starting from the head chief sitting on the right and passing around
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
half of the circle till he reaches an old man seated opposite the head chief.
This old man (one of the Hañga wag¢a) and the head chief are the only
ones who smoke the pipe; those sitting between them do not smoke it
when Iñke-sabě goes around. When the old man has finished smoking
Iñke-sabě takes the pipe again and continues around the circle to the
starting-point, but he gives it to each man to smoke. When he reaches
the head chief on the left he gives it to him, and after receiving it from
him he returns it to the place on the ground before the head chiefs.</p>

<p>When Iñke-sabě reaches the old man referred to [T]e-[p]a-it`ajĭ starts from
the head chiefs with the other pipe, which he hands to each one, including
those sitting between the second head chief and the old man.
[T]e-[p]a-it`ajĭ always keeps behind Iñke-sabě just half the circumference of
the circle, and when he receives the pipe from the head chief on the left he
returns it to its place beside the other. Then, after the smoking is over,
Ictasanda takes the pipes, overturns them to empty out the ashes, and
cleans the bowls by thrusting in a stick. (See §§ <a href="#s111">111</a>, <a href="#s130">130</a>, <a href="#s296">296</a>, etc.)</p>

<p>In smoking they blew the smoke
upwards, saying, "Here, Wakanda,
is the smoke." This was done because
they say that Wakanda gave
them the pipes, and He rules over
them.</p>

<p id="s19">§ 19. Frank La Flèche told the
following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The sacred pipes are not shown to the
common people. When my father was
about to be installed a head chief, Mahi<sup>n</sup>-zi,
whose duty it was to fill the pipes, let one
of them fall to the ground, violating a law,
and so preventing the continuation of the
ceremony. So my father was not fully initiated.
When the later fall was partly
gone Mahi<sup>n</sup>-zi died.</p>

<p>Wacuce, my father-in-law, was the Iñke-sabě
keeper of the pipes. When the Otos
visited the Omahas (in the summer of
1878), the chiefs wished the pipes to be taken out of the coverings, so they ordered
Wacuce to undo the bag. This was unlawful, as the ritual prescribed certain words
to be said by the chiefs to the keeper of the pipes previous to the opening of the bag.
But none of the seven chiefs know the formula. Wacuce was unwilling to break the
law; but the chiefs insisted, and he yielded. Then Two Crows told all the Omahas
present not to smoke the small pipe. This he had a right to do, as he was a Hañga.
Wacuce soon died, and in a short time he was followed by his daughter and his eldest
son.</p>

<p>It takes four days to make any one understand all about the laws of the sacred
pipes; and it costs many horses. A bad man, <i>i. e.</i>, one who is saucy, quarrelsome
stingy, etc., cannot be told such things. This was the reason why the seven chiefs
did not know their part of the ritual.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<h3 id="LAW_OF_MEMBERSHIP">LAW OF MEMBERSHIP.</h3>

<p id="s20">§ 20. A child belongs to its father's gens, as "father-right" has succeeded
"mother-right." But children of white or black men are assigned
to the gentes of their mothers, and they cannot marry any women
of those gentes. A stranger cannot belong to any gens of the tribe,
there being no ceremony of adoption into a gens.</p>

<h3 id="THE_WEJIN_CTE_OR_ELK_GENS">THE WEJI<sup>N</sup>CTE OR ELK GENS.</h3>

<p id="s21">§ 21. This gens occupies the first place in the tribal circles, pitching
its tents at one of the horns or extremities, not far from the Ictasanda
gens, which camps at the other end. When the ancient chieftainship
was abolished in 1880, Mahi<sup>n</sup>-¢iñge was the chief of this gens, having
succeeded Joseph La Flèche in 1865.</p>

<p>The word "Weji<sup>n</sup>cte" cannot be translated, as the meaning of this
archaic word has been forgotten. It may have some connection with
"waji<sup>n</sup>´cte," <i>to be in a bad humor</i>, but we have no means of ascertaining
this.</p>

<p>La Flèche and Two Crows said that there were no subgentes in this
gens. But it seems probable that in former days there were subgentes
in each gens, while in the course of time changes occurred, owing to
decrease in numbers and the advent of the white men.</p>

<p><i>Taboo.</i>&mdash;The members of this gens are afraid to touch any part of the
male elk, or to eat its flesh; and they cannot eat the flesh of the male
deer. Should they accidentally violate this custom they say that they
are sure to break out in boils and white spots on different parts of the
body. But when a member of this gens dies he is buried in moccasins
made of deer skin.</p>

<p><i>Style of wearing the hair.</i>&mdash;The writer noticed that Bi<sup>n</sup>ze-tig¢e, a boy
of this gens, had his hair next the forehead standing erect, and that
back of it was brushed forward till it projected beyond the former. A
tuft of hair at the back extended about 3 inches below the head. This
style of wearing the hair prevails only among the smaller children as
a rule; men and women do not observe it.</p>

<p>Some say that `A<sup>n</sup>-wega<sup>n</sup>¢a is the head of those who join in the worship
of the thunder, but his younger brother, Qaga-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>, being a more
active man, is allowed to have the custody of the Iñg¢a<sup>n</sup>¢ě and the
Iñg¢a<sup>n</sup>hañgac`a. J. La Flèche and Two Crows said that this might be
so; but they did not know about it. Nor could they or my other informants
tell the meaning of Iñg¢a<sup>n</sup>¢ě and Iñg¢a<sup>n</sup>hañgac`a. Perhaps
they refer either to the wild-cat (iñg¢añga), or to the thunder (iñg¢a<sup>n</sup>).
Compare the Ictasanda "keepers of the claws of a wild-cat."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></p>

<p id="s22">§ 22. <i>The sacred tent.</i>&mdash;The sacred tent of the Elk gens is consecrated
to war, and scalps are given to it, but are not fastened to it, as some
have asserted. B¢a<sup>n</sup>ti used to be the keeper of it, but he has resigned
the charge of it to the ex-chief, Mahi<sup>n</sup>-¢iñge.</p>

<p>The place of this sacred tent is within the tribal circle, and near the
camping place of the gens. This tent contains one of the wa¢íxabe, a
sacred bag, made of the feathers and skin of a bird, and consecrated to
war. (See § <a href="#s196">196</a>.) There is also another sacred bag in this tent, that
which holds the sacred ʇíhaba or clam shell, the bladder of a male elk
filled with tobacco, and the sacred pipe of the gens, the tribal war-pipe,
which is made of red pipe-stone. The ʇihaba is about nine inches in
diameter, and about four inches thick. It is kept in a bag of buffalo
hide which is never placed on the ground. In ancient days it was carried
on the back of a youth, but in modern times, when a man could not
be induced to carry it, it was put with its buffalo-skin bag into the skin
of a coyote, and a woman took it on her back. When the tribe is not
in motion the bag is hung on a cedar stick about five feet high, which
had been planted in the ground. The bag is fastened with some of the
sinew of a male elk, and cannot be opened except by a member of the
Wasabe-hit`ajĭ sub-gens of the ₵atada. (See § <a href="#s45">45</a>, etc.)</p>

<p id="s23">§ 23. <i>Service of the scouts.</i>&mdash;When a man walks in dread of some unseen
danger, or when there was an alarm in the camp, a crier went
around the tribal circle, saying, "Maja<sup>n</sup>´ i¢égasañga té wí á¢i<sup>n</sup>he+!" <i>I
who move am he who will know what is the matter with the land!</i> (<i>i. e.</i>,
I will ascertain the cause of the alarm.) Then the chiefs assembled
in the war tent, and about fifty or sixty young men went thither. The
chiefs directed the Elk people to make the young men smoke the sacred
pipe of the Elk gens four times, as those who smoked it were compelled
to tell the truth. Then one of the servants of the Elk gens took out
the pipe and the elk bladder, after untying the elk sinew, removed some
of the tobacco from the pouch (elk bladder), which the Elk men dare
not touch, and handed the pipe with the tobacco to the Elk man, who
filled it and lighted it. They did not smoke with this pipe to the four
winds, nor to the sky and ground. The Elk man gave the pipe to one
of the bravest of the young men, whom he wished to be the leader of
the scouts. After all had smoked the scouts departed. They ran around
the tribal circle, and then left the camp. When they had gone about
20 miles they sat down, and the leader selected a number to act as policemen,
saying, "I make you policemen. Keep the men in order. Do
not desire them to go aside." If there were many scouts, about eight
were made policemen. Sometimes there were two, three, or four leaders
of the scouts, and occasionally they sent some scouts in advance to
distant bluffs. The leaders followed with the main body. When they
reached home the young men scattered, but the leaders went to the Elk
tent and reported what they had ascertained. They made a <i>detour</i>, in
order to avoid encountering the foe, and sometimes they were obliged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
to flee to reach home. This service of the young men was considered
as equivalent to going on the war path.</p>

<p id="s24">§ 24. <i>Worship of the thunder in the spring.</i>&mdash;When the first thunder is
heard in the spring of the year the Elk people call to their servants,
the Bear people, who proceed to the sacred tent of the Elk gens. When
the Bear people arrive one of them opens the sacred bag, and, after removing
the sacred pipe, hands it to one of the Elk men, with some of
the tobacco from the elk bladder. Before the pipe is smoked it is held
toward the sky, and the thunder god is addressed. Joseph La Flèche
and Two Crows do not know the formula, but they said that the following
one, given me by a member of the Ponka Hisada (Wasabe-hit`ajĭ)
gens, may be correct. The thunder god is thus addressed by the Ponkas:
"Well, venerable man, by your striking (with your club) you are
frightening us, your grandchildren, who are here. Depart on high.
According to [P]á¢i<sup>n</sup>na<sup>n</sup>pájĭ, one of the Wasabe-hit`ajĭ, who has acted as
a servant for the Elk people, "At the conclusion of this ceremony the
rain always ceases, and the Bear people return to their homes." But
this is denied by Joseph La Flèche and Two Crows, who say, "How is
it possible for them to stop the rain?"</p>

<p>While the Elk gens is associated with the war path, and the worship
of the thunder god, who is invoked by war chiefs, those war chiefs are
not always members of this gens, but when the warriors return, the
keeper of the sacred bag of this gens compels them to speak the truth
about their deeds. (See § <a href="#s214">214</a>.)</p>

<p id="s25">§ 25. <i>Birth names of boys.</i>&mdash;The following are the birth names of boys
in the Elk gens. These are sacred or nikie names, and sons used to
be so named in former days according to the order of their births. For
example, the first-born son was called the Soft Horn (of the young elk
at its first appearance). The second, Yellow Horn (of the young elk
when a little older). The next, the Branching Horns (of an elk three
years old). The fourth, the Four Horns (of an elk four years old). The
fifth, the Large Pronged Horns (of an elk six or seven years old). The
sixth, the Dark Horns (of a grown elk in summer). The seventh, the
Standing White Horns, in the distance (<i>i. e.</i>, those of a grown elk in
winter).</p>

<p>For instance, when, in any household, a child is named Wasabe-jiñga, that name cannot
be given to any new-born child of that gens.  But when the first bearer of the name
changes his name or dies, another boy can receive the name Wasabe-jiñga.  As that
is one of the seven birth names of the Wasabe-hit`ajĭ it suggests a reason for having
extra nikie names in the gens.  This second kind of nikie names may have been birth
names, resorted to because the original birth names were already used. This law applies
in some degree to girls' names, if parents know that a girl in the gens has a certain
name they cannot give that name to their daughter.  But should that name be chosen
through ignorance, the two girls must be distinguished by adding to their own names
those of their respective fathers.]</p>

<p><i>Other proper names.</i>&mdash;The following are the other nikie<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> names of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
the Elk gens: Elk. Young Elk. Standing Elk. White Elk (near by).

Treads on the ground in walking, or, Passes over what is at the bottom).
Iron Eyes (of an elk). Bullet-shaped Dung (of an elk). (Elk) Is coming

<p id="s26">§ 26. According to [T]e-da-u¢iqaga, the chief A<sup>n</sup>pa<sup>n</sup>-ʇañga, the younger,
had a boat and flag painted on the outside of his skin tent. These were
made "qube," sacred, but were not nikie, because they were not transmitted
from a mythical ancestor.</p>

<p id="s27">§ 27. This gens has furnished several head chiefs since the death of
the famous Black Bird. Among these were A<sup>n</sup>pa<sup>n</sup>-sk&#259; (head chief after
1800), A<sup>n</sup>pa<sup>n</sup>-ʇañga, the elder, the celebrated Big Elk, mentioned by
Long and other early travelers, and A<sup>n</sup>pa<sup>n</sup>-ʇañga, the younger. On the
death of the last, about A.D. 1853, Joseph La Flèche succeeded him
as a head chief.</p>

<h3 id="THE_INKE-SABE_OR_BLACK_SHOULDER_GENS">THE IÑKE-SABĔ, OR BLACK SHOULDER GENS.</h3>

<p id="s28">§ 28. This is a Buffalo gens, and its place in the tribal circle is next to
that of the Elk gens. The head chiefs of this gens in 1880 were Gahige
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
(who died in 1882), and Duba-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>, who "sat on opposite sides of
the gentile <i>fire-place</i>." Gahige's predecessor was Gahige-jiñga or Icka-dabi.</p>

<p><i>Creation myth</i>, told by Gahige.&mdash;The first men created were seven
in number. They were all made at one time. Afterwards seven women
were made for them. At that time there were no gentes; all the people
were as one gens. (Joseph La Flèche and Two Crows never heard
this, and the following was new to them:)</p>

<p><i>Mythical origin</i> of the Iñke-sabě, as related by Gahige.&mdash;The Iñke-sabě
were buffaloes, and dwelt under the surface of the water. When
they came to the surface they jumped about in the water, making it
muddy; hence the birth-name for the first son, Ni-gaqude. Having
reached the land they snuffed at the four winds and prayed to them.
The north and west winds were good, but the south and east winds were
bad.</p>

<p id="s29">§ 29. <i>Ceremony at the death of a member of the gens.</i>&mdash;In former days,
when any member of the gens was near death, he was wrapped in a
buffalo robe, with the hair out, and his face was painted with the privileged
decoration. Then the dying person was addressed thus: "You are
going to the animals (the buffaloes). You are going to rejoin your ancestors.
(Ániʇa dúbaha hné. Wackañ´-g&#259;, i. e.) You are going, or, Your
four souls are going, to the four winds. Be strong!" All the members
of this gens, whether male or female, were thus attired and spoken to
when they were dying. (La Flèche and Two Crows say that nothing is
said about four souls, and that "Wackañ-g&#259;" is not said; but all the
rest may be true. See § <a href="#s35">35</a> for a similar custom.) The "hañga-ʞi`a<sup>n</sup>ze,"
or privileged decoration, referred to above and elsewhere in this monograph,
is made among the Omahas by painting two parallel lines across
the forehead, two on each cheek and two under the nose, one being
above the upper lip and the other between the lower lip and the
chin.</p>

<p id="s30">§ 30. When the tribe went on the buffalo hunt and could get skins
for tents it was customary to decorate the outside of the principal Iñke-sabě
tent, as follows, according to [T]e-[p]a-u¢iqaga: Three circles were
painted, one on each side of the entrance to the tent, and one at the
back, opposite the entrance. Inside each of these was painted a buffalo-head.
Above each circle was a pipe, ornamented with eagle feathers.</p>

<p>Frank La Flèche's sketch is of the regular peace pipe; but his father
drew the calumet pipe, from which the duck's head had been taken and
the pipe-bowl substituted, as during the dancing of the Hedewatci. (See
§§ <a href="#s49">49</a> and <a href="#s153">153</a>.)</p>

<p>A model of the principal [T]e-[p]a-it`ajĭ tent, decorated by a native artist,
was exhibited by Miss Alice C. Fletcher, at the session of the American
Association at Montreal in 1882. It is now at the Peabody Museum.</p>

<p><i>Iñke-sabě style of wearing the hair.</i>&mdash;The smaller boys have their hair
cut in this style. A A, the horns of the buffalo, being two locks of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
hair about two inches long. B is a fringe of hair all around the head.
It is about two inches long. The rest of the head is shaved bare.</p>

<p id="s31">§ 31. <i>Subgentes and Taboos.</i>&mdash;There has evidently been a change in
the subgentes since the advent of the white man. In 1878, the writer
was told by several, including La Flèche, that there were then three subgentes
in existence, Wa¢ígije, Wata<sup>n</sup>´zi-jíde ¢atájĭ, and Naq¢é-it`abájĭ
the fourth, or Íekí¢ě, having become extinct.
Now (1882), La Flèche and Two Crows give the
three subgentes as follows: 1. Wa¢ígije; 2.
Niníba t`a<sup>n</sup>; 3. (a part of 2) Íekí¢ě. The second
subgens is now called by them "Wata<sup>n</sup>´zi-ji´de
¢atájĭ and Naq¢é ít`abájĭ." "[T]a<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>ba and
Nágu or Wa¢ánase are the only survivors of the
real Niniba-t`a<sup>n</sup>, Keepers of the Sacred Pipes."
(Are not these the true Naq¢é-ít`ábájĭ, <i>They
who cannot touch charcoal</i>? <i>I. e.</i>, it is not their
place to touch a fire-brand or the ashes left in
the sacred pipes after they have been used.)
"The Sacred Pipes were taken from the ancestors
of these two and were given into the charge of Ickadabi, the paternal
grandfather of Gahige." Yet these men are still called Niniba-t`a<sup>n</sup>,
while "Gahige belongs to the Wata<sup>n</sup>zi-jide ¢atajĭ  and Naq¢e-it`abajĭ, and
he is one of those from whom the Iekí¢ě could be selected."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>In 1878 La Flèche also gave the divisions and taboos of the Iñke-sabě
as follows: "1. Niniba-t`a<sup>n</sup>; 2. Wata<sup>n</sup>zi-jide ¢atajĭ 3. [T]e-hé-sábě
it`ájĭ 4. [T]e-¢éze¢atájĭ" but he did not state whether these were distinct
subgentes. The [T]e-he-sabě it`ajĭ, Those who touch not black horns
(of buffaloes), appear to be the same as the [T]e-¢eze ¢atajĭ, i. e., the
Wa¢ígije. The following is their camping order: In the tribal circle,
the Wa¢ígije camp next to the Hañga gens, of which the Wacabe people
are the neighbors of the Wa¢igije, having almost the same taboo. The
other Iñke-sabě people camp next to the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte gens. But in the
gentile "council-fire" a different order is observed; the first becomes
last, the Wa¢igije having their seats
on the left of the fire and the door,
and the others on the right.</p>

B.&mdash;The Wata<sup>n</sup>zi-jide ¢atajĭ the Ieki¢ě,
and the Naq¢e-it`abajĭ. These were under Gahige.</p>
</div>

<p>The Wa¢igije cannot eat buffalo
tongues, and they are not allowed
to touch a buffalo head. (See §§
<a href="#s37">37</a>, <a href="#s49">49</a>, and <a href="#s59">50</a>.) The name of their
subgens is that of the hooped rope,
with which the game of "[P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-jahe"
is played. Gahige told the
following, which is doubted by La
Flèche and Two Crows: "One day,
when the principal man of the
Wa¢igije was fasting and praying
to the sun-god, he saw the ghost of
a buffalo, visible from the flank up,
arising out of a spring. Since then the members of his subgens have
abstained from buffalo tongues and heads."</p>

<p>Gahige's subgens, the Wata<sup>n</sup>zi-jide ¢atajĭ, do not eat red corn. They
were the first to find the red corn, but they were afraid of it, and would
not eat it. Should they eat it now, they would have running sores all
around their mouths. Another tradition is that the first man of this
subgens emerged from the water with an ear of red corn in his hand.</p>

<p>The Ieki¢ě are, or were, the Criers, who went around the tribal circle
proclaiming the decisions of the chiefs, etc.</p>

<p>Prior to 1878, Wacuce, Gahige's brother, was the keeper of the two
sacred pipes. At his death, in that year, his young son succeeded him
as keeper; but, as he was very young, he went to the house of his
father's brother, Gahige, who subsequently kept the pipes himself.</p>

<p id="s32">§ 32. Gahige said that his subgens had a series of Eagle birth-names,
as well as the Buffalo birth-names common to the whole gens. This
was owing to the possession of the sacred pipes. While these names
may have denoted the order of birth some time ago, they are now bestowed
without regard to that, according to La Flèche and Two Crows.</p>

<p><i>Buffalo birth-names.</i>&mdash;The first son was called "He who stirs up or
muddies the water by jumping in it," referring to a buffalo that lies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
down in the water or paws in the shallow water, making it spread out
in circles. The second son was "Buffaloes swimming in large numbers
across a stream." The third was [S]i-ʞa<sup>n</sup>-qega, referring to a buffalo
calf, the hair on whose legs changes from a black to a withered or dead
hue in February. The fourth was "Knobby Horns (of a young buffalo
bull)". The fifth was "He (<i>i. e.</i>, a buffalo bull) walks well, without fear
of falling." The sixth was "He (a buffalo bull) walks slowly (because
he is getting old)." The seventh was called Gaqaʇa-naji<sup>n</sup>, explained by
the clause, "ʇenúga-wi<sup>n</sup>áqtci, júg¢e ¢iñgé, a single buffalo bull, without
a companion." It means a very old bull, who stands off at one side
apart from the herd.</p>

<p><i>The Eagle birth-names</i> (see § <a href="#s64">64</a>), given by Gahige, are as follows:
Qi¢á-i<sup>n</sup><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> (meaning unknown to La Flèche and Two Crows; word doubted
by them). Eagle Neck. Waji<sup>n</sup>-hañga, He who leads in disposition.
Ki<sup>n</sup>ka-ʇañga, the first bird heard in the spring when the grass comes
up (the marbled godwit?). Blue Neck (denied by La Flèche and Two
Crows). Rabbit (La Flèche and Two Crows said that this name belonged
to the Hañga gens). Ash tree (doubted by La Flèche and Two
Crows). A birth-name of this series could be used instead of the corresponding
one of the gentile series, <i>e. g.</i>, Gahige could have named
his son, Uka<sup>n</sup>adig¢a<sup>n</sup>, either Siʞa<sup>n</sup>-qega or Waji<sup>n</sup>-hañga. There were
similar series of birth-names for girls, but they have been forgotten.</p>

<h3 id="THE_HANGA_GENS">THE HAÑGA GENS.</h3>

<p id="s34">§ 34. Hañga seems to mean, "foremost," or "ancestral." Among the
Omahas this gens is a buffalo gens; but among the Kansas and Osages
it refers to other gentes. In the Omaha tribal circle, the Hañga people
camp next to the Iñkě-sabe. Their two chiefs are Two Crows and Icta-basude,
elected in 1880. The latter was elected as the successor of his
father, "Yellow Smoke," or "Two Grizzly Bears."</p>

<p><i>Mythical origin of the gens.</i>&mdash;According to Yellow Smoke, the first
Hañga people were buffaloes and dwelt beneath the water. When they
were there they used to move along with their heads bowed and their
eyes closed. By and by they opened their eyes in the water; hence
their first birth-name, Niadi-icta-ugab¢a. Emerging from the water,
they lifted their heads and saw the blue sky for the first time. So they
assumed the name of [K]e¢a-gaxe, or "Clear sky makers." (La Flèche,
in 1879, doubted whether this was a genuine tradition of the gens; and
he said that the name Niadi-icta-ugab¢a was not found in the Hañga
gens; it was probably intended for Niadi-ctagabi. This referred to a
buffalo that had fallen into mud and water, which had spoiled its flesh
for food, so that men could use nothing but the hide. Two Crows said
that Niadi-ctagabi was an ancient name.)</p>

<p id="s35">§ 35. <i>Ceremony at the death of a member of the gens.</i>&mdash;In former days,
when any member of the gens was near death he was wrapped in a
buffalo robe, with the hair out, and his face was painted with the "hañga-ʞi`a<sup>n</sup>ze."
Then the dying person was thus addressed by one of his
gens: "You came hither from the animals. And you are going back
thither. Do not face this way again. When you go, continue walking."
(See § <a href="#s29">29</a>.)</p>

<p id="s36">§ 36. <i>The sacred tents.</i>&mdash;There are two sacred tents belonging to this
gens. When the tribal circle is formed these are pitched within it,
about 50 yards from the tents of the gens. Hence the proper name,
U¢uci-naji<sup>n</sup>. A straight line drawn from one to the other would bisect
the road of the tribe at right angles.</p>

<p>The sacred tents are always together. They pertain to the buffalo
hunt, and are also "wéwaspe," having a share in the regulative system
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
of the tribe, as they contain two objects which have been regarded as
"Wakañda éga<sup>n</sup>," partaking of the nature of deities.</p>

<p>These objects are the sacred pole or "waq¢éxe," and the "ʇe-sa<sup>n</sup>´-ha."
The decoration of the outside of each sacred tent is as follows: A cornstalk
on each side of the entrance and one on the back of the tent,
opposite the entrance. (Compare the ear of corn in the calumet dance.
See §§ <a href="#s123">123</a> and <a href="#s163">163</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Tradition of the sacred pole.</i>&mdash;The "waq¢exe," "ja<sup>n</sup>´ waqúbe," or sacred
pole, is very old, having been cut more than two hundred years
ago, before the separation of the Omahas, Ponkas, and Iowas. The
Ponkas still claim a share in it, and have a tradition about it, which is
denied by La Flèche and Two Crows. The Ponkas say that the tree
from which the pole was cut was first found by a Ponka of the Hisada
gens, and that in the race which ensued a Ponka of the Maka<sup>n</sup> gens
was the first to reach the tree. The Omahas tell the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At the first there were no chiefs in the gentes, and the people did not prosper. So
a council was held, and they asked one another, "What shall we do to improve our
condition?" Then the young men were sent out. They found many cotton-wood
trees beside a lake, but one of these was better than the rest. They returned and reported
the tree, speaking of it as if it was a person. All rushed to the attack. They
struck it and felled it as if it had been a foe. They then put hair on its head, making
a person of it. Then were the sacred tents made, the first chiefs were selected, and
the sacred pipes were distributed.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sacred pole was originally longer than it is now, but the lower
part having worn out, a piece of ash-wood, about 18 inches long, has
been fastened to the cotton-wood with a soft piece of cord made of a
buffalo hide. The ash-wood forms the bottom of the pole, and is the
part which is stuck in the ground at certain times. The cotton-wood is
about 8 feet long.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span>&mdash;The sacred pole.</p>

<p>A.&mdash;The place where the two pieces of wood are joined.</p>

<p>B.&mdash;The aqande-pa or hi<sup>n</sup>-qpe-i¢iba<sup>n</sup>, made of the down of the mi<sup>n</sup>xa (a swan. See the Ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka gaxe
gens.)</p>

<p>C.&mdash;The scalp, fastened to the top, whence the proper name, Nik'umi<sup>n</sup>je, Indian-man's (scalp) couch.</p>
</div>

<p>Two Crows said that the pole rested on the scalp when it was in the
lodge. The proper name, Mi<sup>n</sup>-wasa<sup>n</sup>, referring to the mi<sup>n</sup>xasa<sup>n</sup> or swan,
and also to the aqande-pa (B). The proper name, "Yellow Smoke"
(rather), "Smoked Yellow," or Cude-nazi, also refers to the pole, which
has become yellow from smoke. Though a scalp is fastened to the top,
the pole has nothing to do with war. But when the Omahas encounter
enemies, any brave man who gets a scalp may decide to present it to
the sacred pole. The middle of the pole has swan's down wrapped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
around it, and the swan's down is covered with cotton-wood bark, over
which is a piece of ʇéha (buffalo hide) about 18 inches square. All the
ʇeha and cord is made of the hide of a hermaphrodite buffalo. This
pole used to be greased every year when they were about to return home
from the summer hunt. The people were afraid to neglect this ceremony
lest there should be a deep snow when they traveled on the next
hunt.</p>

<p>When Joseph La Flèche lost his leg, the old men told the people that
this was a punishment which he suffered because he had opposed the
greasing of the sacred pole. As the Omahas have not been on the hunt
for about seven years, the sacred tents are kept near the house of Waka<sup>n</sup>-ma<sup>n</sup>₵i<sup>n</sup>.
(See § <a href="#s295">295</a>.)</p>

<p>The other sacred tent, which is kept at present by Waka<sup>n</sup>-ma<sup>n</sup>₵i<sup>n</sup>, contains
the sacred "ʇe-sa<sup>n</sup>´-ha," the skin of a white buffalo cow, wrapped
in a buffalo hide that is without hair.</p>

<p>Joseph La Flèche had two horses that ran away and knocked over
the sacred tents of the Hañga gens. The two old men caught them and
rubbed them all over with wild sage, saying to Frank La Flèche, "If
you let them do that again the buffaloes shall gore them."</p>

<p id="s37">§ 37. <i>Subgentes</i> and Taboos.&mdash;There are two great divisions of the
gens, answering to the number of the sacred tents: The Keepers of the
Sacred Pole and The Keepers of the [T]e-sa<sup>n</sup>-ha. Some said that there
were originally four subgentes, but two have become altogether or
nearly extinct, and the few survivors have joined the larger subgentes.</p>

<p>There are several names for each subgens. The first which is sometimes
spoken of as being "Ja<sup>n</sup>´ha-aʇá¢ica<sup>n</sup>," pertaining to the sacred
cotton-wood bark, is the "Waq¢éxe a¢i<sup>n</sup>´" or the "Ja<sup>n</sup>´ waqúbe a¢i<sup>n</sup>´,"
Keepers of the Sacred Pole. When its members are described by their
taboos, they are called the "[T]á waqúbe ¢atájĭ," those who do not eat
the "ʇa" or buffalo sides; and "Mi<sup>n</sup>xa-sa<sup>n</sup> ¢atájĭ" and "[P]éta<sup>n</sup> ¢atájĭ,"
those who do not eat geese, swans, and cranes. These can eat the
buffalo tongues. The second subgens, which is often referred to as
being "[T]e-sa<sup>n</sup>´-ha-ʇá¢ica<sup>n</sup>," pertaining to the sacred skin of the white
buffalo cow, consists of the Wacábe or Hañ´gaqti, the Real Hañga people.
When reference is made to their taboo, they are called the "[T]e¢éze ¢atájĭ,"
as they cannot eat buffalo tongues; but they are at liberty
to eat the "ʇa," which the other Hañga cannot eat. In the tribal circle
the Wacabe people camp next to the Iñke-sabě gens; and the Waq¢éxe
a¢i<sup>n</sup> have the Quʞa of the ₵atada] gens next to them, as he is their servant
and is counted as one of their kindred. But, in the gentile circle,
the Waq¢éxe a¢i<sup>n</sup> occupy the left side of the "council-fire," and the
Wacabe sit on the opposite side.</p>

<p id="s38">§ 38. <i>Style of wearing the hair.</i>&mdash;The Hañga style of wearing the hair
is called "ʇe-nañ´ka-báxe," referring originally to the back of a buffalo.
It is a crest of hair, about 2 inches long, standing erect, and extending
from one ear to the other. The ends of the hair are a little below
the ears.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<p id="s39">§ 39. <i>Birth-names of boys</i>, according to [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ. The first is
Niadi ctagabi; the second, Ja<sup>n</sup>-gáp'uje, referring to the Sacred Pole.
It may be equivalent to the Dakota Tca<sup>n</sup>-kap'oja (Ća&#331;-kapoźa), meaning
that it must be carried by one unencumbered with much baggage.
The third is named Ma<sup>n</sup> pějĭ, Bad Arrow, <i>i. e.</i>, Sacred Arrow, because
the arrow has grown black from age! (Two Crows gave this explanation.
It is probable that the arrow is kept in or with the "ʇe-sa<sup>n</sup>-ha.")</p>

<p>The fourth is Fat covering the outside of a buffalo's stomach. The
fifth is Buffalo bull. The sixth, Dangerous buffalo bull; and the seventh
is Buffalo bull rolls again in the place where he rolled formerly.</p>

<p id="s40">§ 40. <i>Principal</i> Hañga <i>names.</i> I. <i>Men.</i>&mdash;(Buffalo) Makes a Dust by

<h3 id="THE_CATADA_GENS">THE ₵ATADA GENS.</h3>

<p id="s41">§ 41. This gen occupies the fourth place in the tribal circle, being between
the Hañga and the [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze. But, unlike the other gentes, its subgentes
have separate camping areas. Were it not for the marriage law,
we should say that the ₵atada was a phratry, and its subgentes were
gentes. The present leaders of the gens are [P]edegahi of the Wajiñga-¢atajĭ
and Cyu-jiñga of the Wasabe-hit`ajĭ. When on the hunt the four
subgentes pitch their tents in the following order in the tribal circle:
1. Wasabe-hit`ajĭ 2. Wajiñga ¢atajĭ 3. [T]e-da-it`ajĭ 4. [K]e-`i<sup>n</sup>. The Wasabe-hit`ajĭ
are related to the Hañga on the one hand and to the Wajiñga-¢atajĭ
on the other. The latter in turn, are related to the [T]e-da-itajĭ
these are related to the [K]e-`i<sup>n</sup>; and the [K]e-`i<sup>n</sup> and [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze are related.</p>

<h4 id="THE_WASABE-HITAJI_SUBGENS">THE WASABE-HIT`AJĬ SUBGENS.</h4>

<p id="s42">§ 42. The name of this subgens is derived from three words: wasabe,
<i>a black bear</i>; ha, <i>a skin</i>; and it`ajĭ, <i>not to touch</i>; meaning "Those who do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
not touch the skin of a black bear." The writer was told in 1879, that
the uju, or principal man of this subgens, was Icta-duba, but La Flèche
and Two Crows, in 1882, asserted that they never heard of an "uju" of
a gens.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Taboo.</i>&mdash;The members of this subgens are prohibited from touching
the hide of a black bear and from eating its flesh.</p>

<p><i>Mythical origin.</i>&mdash;They say that their ancestors were made under the
ground and that they afterwards came to the surface.</p>

<p id="s43">§ 43. Plate II is a sketch of a tent which belonged to Agaha-wacuce,
the father of [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ. Hupe¢a's father, Hupe¢a II, owned it
before Agaha-wacuce obtained it. The circle at the top representing a
bear's cave, is sometimes painted blue. Below the zigzag lines (representing
the different kinds of thunders?) are the prints of bear's paws.
This painting was not a nikie but the personal "qube" or sacred thing
of the owner. The lower part of the tent was blackened with ashes or
charcoal.</p>

<p id="s44">§ 44. <i>Style of wearing the hair.</i>&mdash;Four short locks are left on the head,

<p><i>Birth-names of boys.</i>&mdash;[P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ gave
the following: The first son is called Young
Black bear. The second, Black bear. The
third, Four Eyes, including the true eyes and
the two spots like eyes that are above the
eyes of a black bear. The fourth, Gray Foot.
The fifth, Cries like a Raccoon. (La Flèche
said that this is a Ponka name, but the
Omahas now have it.) The sixth, Nídaha<sup>n</sup>,
Progressing toward maturity (<i>sic</i>). The
seventh, He turns round and round suddenly
(said of both kinds of bears).</p>

<p id="s45">§ 45. <i>Sections of the subgens.</i>&mdash;The Wasabe-hit`ajĭ people are divided into sections. [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ
and others told the writer that they consisted of four divisions:
Black bear, Raccoon, Grizzly bear, and Porcupine people. The Black
bear and Raccoon people are called brothers. And when a man kills
a black bear he says, "I have killed a raccoon." The young black bear
is said to cry like a raccoon, hence the birth-name Miʞa-xage. The
writer is inclined to think that there is some foundation for these statements,
though La Flèche and Two Crows seemed to doubt them. They
gave but two divisions of the Wasabe-hit`ajĭ and it may be that these
two are the only ones now in existence, while there were four in ancient
times. The two sections which are not doubted are the Wasabe-hit`ajĭ
proper, and the Quʞa, <i>i. e.</i>, the Raccoon people.</p>

<p>When they meet as a subgens, they sit thus in their circle: The
Wasabe-hit`ajĭ people sit on the right of the entrance, and the Quʞa
have their places on the left. But in the tribal circle the Quʞa people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
camp next to the Hañga Keepers of the Sacred Pole, as the former are
the servants of the Hañga. The leader of the Quʞa or Singers was
himself the only one who acted as quʞa, when called on to serve the
Hañga. [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ's half-brother, Hupe¢a, commonly styled [T]e-da-u¢iqaga,
used to be the leader. Since the Omahas have abandoned the
hunt, to which this office pertained, no one has acted as quʞa; but if
it were still in existence, the three brothers, Dangerous, Gihajĭ, and
Ma<sup>n</sup>-¢i`u-ke, are the only ones from whom the quʞa could be chosen.</p>

<p>Quʞa men.&mdash;Dried Buffalo Skull. Dangerous. Gihajĭ. Black bear.
Paws the Ground as he Reclines. Young (black bear) Runs. Mandan.
Hupe¢a. Laugher. Maqpiya-qaga. [T]añga-gaxe. Crow's Head. Gray
Foot. J. La Flèche said that Hupe¢a, Laugher, Maqpiya-qaga, and
[T]añga-gaxe were servants of the Elk gens; but [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ, their
fellow-gentile, places them among the Quʞa. (See § <a href="#s143">143</a>.)</p>

<p>In the tribal circle the Wasabe-hit`ajĭ proper camp next to the
Wajiñga-¢atajĭ. These Wasabe-hit`ajĭ are the servants of the Elk people,
whom they assist in the worship of the thunder-god. When this
ceremony takes place there are a few of the Quʞa people who accompany
the Wasabe-hit`ajĭ and act as servants. These are probably the
four men referred to above. Though all of the Wasabe-hit`ajĭ proper
are reckoned as servants of the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte, only two of them, [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ
and Sida-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>, take a prominent part in the ceremonies described
in §§ <a href="#s23">23</a>, <a href="#s24">24</a>. Should these men die or refuse to act, other members
of their Section must take their places.</p>

can eat wild turkeys, all birds of the mi<sup>n</sup>xa or goose genus, including
ducks and cranes. When sick, they are allowed to eat prairie chickens.
When members of this subgens go on the warpath, the only sacred
things which they have are the g¢eda<sup>n</sup> (hawk) and nickucku (martin).
(See § <a href="#s196">196</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Style of wearing the hair.</i>&mdash;They leave a little hair in front, over the
forehead, for a bill, and some at the back of the head, for the bird's tail,
with much over each ear, for the wings. La Flèche and Two Crows do
not deny this; but they know nothing about it.</p>

<p><i>Curious custom during harvest.</i>&mdash;These Wajiñga-¢atajĭ call themselves
"The Blackbird people." In harvest time, when the birds used to eat
the corn, the men of this subgens proceeded thus: They took some
corn, which they chewed and spit around over the field. They thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
that such a procedure would deter the birds from making further inroads
upon the crops.</p>

<p>Wacka<sup>n</sup>-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup> of this subgens keeps one of the great wa¢ixabe, or
sacred bags, used when a warrior's word is doubted. (See § <a href="#s196">196</a>.)</p>

<p id="s47">§ 47. <i>Sections and subsections of the subgens.</i>&mdash;Waniʇa-waqě of the
[T]a-da gens told me that the following were the divisions of the Wajiñga-¢atajĭ
but La Flèche and Two Crows deny it. It may be that these
minor divisions no longer exist, or that they were not known to the two
men.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I.&mdash;Hawk people, under Standing Hawk.</p>

<p>II.&mdash;Mañg¢iqta, or Blackbird people, under Waji<sup>n</sup>a-gahige. Subsections:
(<i>a</i>) White heads. (<i>b</i>) Red heads. (<i>c</i>) Yellow
heads. (<i>d</i>) Red wings.</p>

<p>III.&mdash;Mañg¢iqta-qude, Gray Blackbird (the common starling), or
Thunder people, under Wa¢idaxe. Subsections: (<i>a</i>) Gray
Blackbirds. (<i>b</i>) Meadow larks. (<i>c</i>) Prairie-chickens; and,
judging from the analogy of the Ponka Hisada, (<i>d</i>) Martins.</p>

<p>IV.&mdash;Three subsections of the Owl and Magpie people are (<i>a</i>) Great
Owls. (<i>b</i>) Small Owls. (<i>c</i>) Magpies.</p></blockquote>

<p id="s48">§ 48. <i>Birth-names of boys.</i>&mdash;The first son was called, Mañg¢iqta, Blackbird.
The second, Red feathers on the base of the wings. The third,
White-eyed Blackbird. The fourth, Dried Wing. The fifth, Hawk
(denied by La Flèche). The sixth, Gray Hawk. The seventh, White
Wings. This last is a Ponka name, according to La Flèche and Two
Crows.</p>

<p>Wajiñga-¢atajĭ <i>men</i>.&mdash;Red Wings. Chief who Watches over (any
thing). Becomes Suddenly Motionless. Poor man. Standing Hawk.
He from whom they flee. Rustling Horns. Scabby Horns. The one
Moving towards the Dew (?). White or Jack Rabbit. Gray Blackbird.
White Blackbird. Four Hands (or Paws). Ni-¢actage. Yellow Head
(of a blackbird). Fire Chief. Coyote's Foot. Buffalo bull Talks like a
chief. Bad temper of a Buffalo bull. White Buffalo in the distance.
Hominy (a name of ridicule). He who continues Trying (commonly
translated, "Hard Walker"). He who makes the crackling sound
"Gh+!" in thundering. Bird Chief.</p>

<p>Wajiñga-¢atajĭ <i>women</i>.&mdash;(Female eagle) Is Moving On high. Moon in
motion during the Day. Turning Moon Female. Mi<sup>n</sup>daca<sup>n</sup>-¢i<sup>n</sup>. Mi<sup>n</sup>tena.
Visible one that Has returned, and is in a Horizontal attitude.</p>

<h4 id="THE_TE_PA-ITAJI_SUBGENS">THE [T]E-[P]A-IT`AJĬ SUBGENS.</h4>

<p id="s49">§ 49. These are the Eagle people, and they are not allowed to touch a
buffalo head. (See Iñke-sabě gens, §§ <a href="#s30">30</a>, <a href="#s32">32</a>.) The writer was told
that their uju or head man in 1879 was Mañge-zi.</p>

<p>He who is the head of the Niniba t`a<sup>n</sup>, Keepers of a (Sacred) Pipe, has
duties to perform whenever the chiefs assemble in council. (See Sacred
Pipes, § <a href="#s18">18</a>.)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p>The decoration of the tents in this subgens resemble those of the
Iñke-sabě.</p>

<p id="s50">§ 50. <i>Birth names of boys.</i>&mdash;The first was called Dried Eagle. [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ
said that this really meant "Dried buffalo skull;" but La Flèche
and Two Crows denied this, giving another meaning, "Dried Eagle
skin." The second was Pipe. The third, Eaglet. The fourth, Real
Bald Eagle. The sixth, Standing Bald Eagle. The seventh, He (an
eagle) makes the ground Shake suddenly by Alighting on it.</p>

<p id="s51">§ 51. <i>Sections of the Subgens.</i>&mdash;Lion gave the following, which were
doubted by La Flèche and Two Crows. I. <i>Keepers of the Pipe</i>, or
<i>Workers</i>, under Eaglet. II. <i>Under The-Only</i>-Hañga are Pidaiga, Wadjepa,
and Ma<sup>n</sup>ze-guhe. III. <i>Under Real Eagle</i> are his son, Eagle makes
a Crackling sound by alighting on a limb of a tree, Wasaapa, Gakie-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>,
and Tcaza-¢iñge. IV. To the <i>Bald Eagle section</i> belong Yellow
Breast and Small Hill. The Omahas reckon three kinds of eagles, the
white eagle, the young white eagle, and the spotted eagle. To these
they add the bald eagle, which they say is not a real eagle. These
probably correspond with the sections of the [T]e-[p]a-it`ajĭ.</p>

<h4 id="THE_KEIN_SUBGENS">THE [K]E-`I<sup>n</sup>, OR TURTLE SUBGENS.</h4>

<p id="s52">§ 52. This subgens camps between the [T]e-[p]a-it`ajĭ and the [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze, in
the tribal circle. Its head man in 1879 was said to be [T]enuga-ja<sup>n</sup>-¢iñke.
[K]e`i<sup>n</sup> means "to carry a turtle on one's back." The members of this
subgens are allowed to touch or carry a turtle, but they cannot eat one.</p>

<p><i>Style of wearing the hair.</i>&mdash;They cut off all the hair from a boy's head,
except six locks; two are left on each side, one over the forehead, and
one hanging down the back, in imitation of the legs, head, and tail of a
turtle. La Flèche and Two Crows did not know about this, but they
said that it might be true.</p>

<p><i>Decoration of the tents.</i>&mdash;The figures of turtles were painted on the
outside of the tents. (See the Iñke-sabě decorations, §§ <a href="#s30">30</a>-<a href="#s32">32</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Curious custom during a fog.</i>&mdash;In the time of a fog the men of this
subgens drew the figure of a turtle on the ground with its face to the
south. On the head, tail, middle of the back, and on each leg were
placed small pieces of a (red) breech-cloth with some tobacco. This
they imagined would make the fog disappear very soon.</p>

<p id="s53">§ 53. <i>Birth names of boys.</i>&mdash;The first son was called He who Passed
by here on his way back to the Water; the second, He who runs very
swiftly to get back to the Water; the third, He who floats down the
stream; the fourth, Red Breast; the fifth, Big Turtle; the sixth,
Young one who carries a turtle on his back; the seventh, Turtle that
kicks out his legs and paws the ground when a person takes hold of
him.</p>

<p><i>Sections of the subgens.</i>&mdash;Lion gave the following as sections of the
[K]e-`i<sup>n</sup>, though the statement was denied by La Flèche and Two Crows.
"The first section is Big Turtle, under [P]ahe-ʇa[p]`ě, in 1878. The second
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
is Turtle that does not flee, under Cage-sk&#259; or Nistu-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>. The
third is Red-breasted Turtle, under [T]enuga-ja<sup>n</sup>-¢iñke. The fourth is
Spotted Turtle with Red Eyes, under Ehna<sup>n</sup>-juwag¢e."</p>

<p><i>Turtle men.</i>&mdash;Heat makes (a turtle) Emerge from the mud. (Turtle)
Walks Backward. He Walks (or continues) Seeking something. Ancestral
Turtle. Turtle that Flees not. (Turtle that) Has gone into the
Lodge (or Shell). He alone is with them. He Continues to Tread on
them. Turtle Maker. Spotted Turtle with Red Eyes. Young Turtle-carrier.
Buzzard. He who Starts up a Turtle.</p>

<p>One of the women is Egg Female.</p>

<h3 id="THE_KANZE_GENS">THE [K]A<sup>n</sup>ZE GENS.</h3>

<p id="s54">§ 54. The place of the [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze or Kansas gens is between the [K]e-`i<sup>n</sup> and
the Ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka-gaxe in the tribal circle. The head man of the gens who
was recognized as such in 1879 was Za<sup>n</sup>zi-mande.</p>

<p><i>Taboo.</i>&mdash;The [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze people cannot touch verdigris, which they call
"wase-ʇu," green clay, or "wase-ʇu-qude," gray-green clay.</p>

<p>Being Wind people, they flap their blankets to start a breeze which
will drive off the musquitoes.</p>

<p><i>Subgentes.</i>&mdash;La Flèche and Two Crows recognize but two of these:
Keepers of a Pipe and Wind People. They assign to the former
Maja<sup>n</sup>ha¢i<sup>n</sup>, Maja<sup>n</sup>-kide, &amp;c., and to the latter Waji<sup>n</sup>-¢icage, Za<sup>n</sup>zi-mandě,
and their near kindred. But Lion said that there were four subgentes,
and that Maja<sup>n</sup>ha¢i<sup>n</sup> was the head man of the first, or Niniba
t`a<sup>n</sup>, which has another name, Those who Make the Sacred tent. He
gave Waji<sup>n</sup>-¢icage as the head man of the Wind people, Za<sup>n</sup>zi-mandě as
the head of the third subgens, and Maja<sup>n</sup>-kide of the fourth; but he
could not give the exact order in which they sat in their gentile circle.</p>

<p>A member of the gens told the writer that Four Peaks, whom Lion
assigned to Za<sup>n</sup>zi-mandě's subgens, was the owner of the sacred tent;
but he did not say to what sacred tent he referred.</p>

<p>Some say that Maja<sup>n</sup>ha¢i<sup>n</sup> was the keeper of the sacred pipe of his
gens till his death in 1879. Others, including Frank La Flèche, say
that Four Peaks was then, and still is, the keeper of the pipe.</p>

<p>According to La Flèche and Two Crows, a member of this gens was
chosen as crier when the brave young men were ordered to take part in
the sham fight. (See § <a href="#s152">152</a>.) "This was Maja<sup>n</sup>ha-¢i<sup>n</sup>" (<i>Frank La Flèche</i>).</p>

<p id="s55">§ 55. <i>Names of Kansas men.</i>&mdash;Thick Hoofs. Something Wanting. Not
worn from long use. He only is great in his own estimation. Boy who
talks like a chief. Young one that Flies [?]. He Lay down On the way.

Wind Female. Coming back Gray.</p>

<h3 id="THE_MANCINKA-GAXE_GENS">THE MA<sup>n</sup>₵IÑKA-GAXE GENS.</h3>

<p id="s56">§ 56. This gens, which is the first of the Ictasanda gentes, camps next
to the [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze, but on the opposite side of the road.</p>

<p>The chief of the gens is Cañge-sk&#259;, or White Horse, a grandson of the
celebrated Black Bird.</p>

<p>The name Ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka-gaxe means "the earth-lodge makers," but the
members of this gens call themselves the Wolf (and Prairie Wolf)
People.</p>

<p><i>Tradition.</i>&mdash;The principal nikie of the Ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka-gaxe are the coyote,
the wolf, and the sacred stones. La Flèche and Two Crows say that
these are all together. Some say that there are two sacred stones, one
of which is red, the other black; others say that both stones have been
reddened. (See § <a href="#s16">16</a>.) La Flèche and Two Crows have heard that there
were four of these stones; one being black, one red, one yellow, and
one blue. (See the colors of the lightning on the tent of Agaha-wacuce,
§ <a href="#s43">43</a>.) One tradition is that the stones were made by the Coyote in ancient
days to be used for conjuring enemies. The Osage tradition mentions
four stones of different colors, white, black, red, and blue.</p>

<p><i>Style of wearing the hair.</i>&mdash;Boys have two locks of hair left on their
heads, one over the forehead and another at the parting of the hair on
the crown. Female children have four locks left, one at the front, one
at the back, and one over each ear. La Flèche and Two Crows do not
know this, but they say that it may be true.</p>

<p id="s57">§ 57. <i>Subgentes.</i>&mdash;La Flèche and Two Crows gave but two of these:
Keepers of the Pipe and Sacred Persons. This is evidently the classification
for marriage purposes, referred to in § <a href="#s78">78</a>; and the writer is confident
that La Flèche and Two Crows always mean this when they speak
of the divisions of each gens. This should be borne in mind, as it will
be helpful in solving certain seeming contradictions. That these two
are not the only divisions of the gens will appear from the statements
of Lion and Cañge-sk&#259;, the latter being the chief of the gens. Cañge-sk&#259;
said that there were three subgentes, as follows: 1. Qube (including
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
the Wolf people?). 2. Niniba t`a<sup>n</sup>. 3. Mi<sup>n</sup>´xa-sa<sup>n</sup> wet`ájĭ. Lion gave
the following: 1. Mi´ʞasi (Coyote and Wolf people). 2. I<sup>n</sup>´`ě waqúbe,
Keepers of the Sacred Stones. 3. Niníba t`a<sup>n</sup>. 4. Mi<sup>n</sup>´xa-sa<sup>n</sup> wet`ájĭ.
According to Cañge-sk&#259;, Qube was the name given to his part of the
gens after the death of Black Bird; therefore it is a modern name, not
a hundred years old. But I<sup>n</sup>´`ě-waqúbe points to the mythical origin of
the gens; hence the writer is inclined to accept the fourfold division as
the ancient one. The present head of the Coyote people is [T]aqie-tig¢e,
whose predecessor was Hu-¢agebe. Cañge-sk&#259;, of the second subgens,
is the successor of his father, who bore the same name. Uckadajĭ is the
rightful keeper of the Sacred Pipe, but as he is very old Ca<sup>n</sup>ta<sup>n</sup>-jiñga
has superseded him, according to [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ. Mi<sup>n</sup>xa-sk&#259; was the
head of the Mi<sup>n</sup>xa-sa<sup>n</sup> wet`ajĭ, but Mañga`ajĭ has succeeded him. The
name of this last subgens means "Those who do not touch swans,"
but this is only a name, not a taboo, according to some of the Omahas.</p>

<p>Among the Kansas Indians, the Ma<sup>n</sup>yiñka-gaxe people used to include
the Elk gens, and part of the latter is called, Mi<sup>n</sup>´xa únikaci<sup>n</sup>ga, Swan
people. As these were originally a subgens of the Kansas Ma<sup>n</sup>yiñka-gaxe,
it furnishes another reason for accepting the statement of Lion
about the Omaha Mi<sup>n</sup>xa-sa<sup>n</sup>-wet`ajĭ.</p>

<p id="s58">§ 58. <i>Birth-names of boys.</i>&mdash;[P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ gave the following, but he
did not know their exact order: He who Continues to Travel (denied
by the La Flèche and Two Crows). Little Tail (of a coyote). Sudden
Crunching sound (made by a coyote or wolf when gnawing bones).
(Coyote) Wheels around suddenly. (Coyote) Stands erect very suddenly.
Surly Wolf.</p>

<p><i>Names of men.</i> I. <i>Wolf subgens.</i>&mdash;Sudden crunching sound. Wacicka.
Continues Running. Wheels around suddenly. The Standing one who
is Traveling. (Wolf) Makes a sudden Crackling sound (by alighting

subgens. III. Niniba-t`a<sup>n</sup> <i>subgens</i>.&mdash;He who Rushes into battle. Young
Wolf. Saucy Chief. IV. <i>Swan subgens.</i>&mdash;He whom an Arrow Fails

not an Omaha name.</p>

<p><i>Names of women.</i>&mdash;Hawk-Female. New Hawk-Female. Miacte-cta<sup>n</sup>,
or Miate-cta<sup>n</sup>. Mi<sup>n</sup>-miʇega. Visible Moon. (Wolf) Stands erect. White
Ponka in the distance. Ponka Female. She who is Ever Coming back

<h3 id="THE_TE-SINDE_GENS">THE [T]E-SĬNDE GENS.</h3>

<p id="s59">§ 59. The [T]e-sĭnde, or Buffalo-tail gens, camps between the Ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka-gaxe
and the [T]a-[p]a gentes in the tribal circle. Its present chief is
Waha<sup>n</sup>-¢iñge, son of Takunaki¢abi.</p>

<p><i>Taboos.</i>&mdash;The members of this gens cannot eat a calf while it is red,
but they can do so when it becomes black. This applies to the calf of
the domestic cow, as well as to that of the buffalo. They cannot touch
a buffalo head.&mdash;<i>Frank La Flèche.</i> (See §§ <a href="#s31">31</a>, <a href="#s37">37</a>, and <a href="#s49">49</a>.) They cannot
eat the meat on the lowest rib, ʇe¢iʇ-ucag¢e, because the head of the
calf before birth touches the mother near that rib.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;[T]e-sĭnde style
of wearing the hair.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Style of wearing the hair.</i>&mdash;It is called "[T]áihi<sup>n</sup>-múxa-gáxai," <i>Mane
made muxa</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, to stand up and hang over a
little on each side. La Flèche and Two Crows do
not know this style.</p>

<p id="s60">§ 60. <i>Birth-names of boys.</i>&mdash;[P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ was uncertain
about them. He thought that six of them
were as follows: Gray Horns (of a buffalo). Uma-abi,
refers to cutting up a buffalo. (A buffalo that
is almost grown) Raises his Tail in the air. Dark
Eyes (A buffalo calf when it sheds its reddish-yellow
hair, has a coat of black, which commences
at the eyes). (Buffalo Calf) Unable to Run. Little
one (buffalo calf) with reddish-yellow hair.</p>

<p id="s61">§ 61. <i>Subgentes.</i>&mdash;For marriage purposes, the gens
is undivided, according to La Flèche and Two Crows; but they admitted
that there were at present two parts of the gens, one of which
was The Keepers of the Pipe. Lion said that he knew of but two
subgentes, which were The Keepers of the Pipe, or, Those who do not
Eat the Lowest buffalo rib, under Wild sage; and Those who Touch no
Calves, or, Keepers of the Sweet Medicine, under Orphan. J. La Flèche
said that all of the [T]e-sĭnde had the sweet medicine, and that none were
allowed to eat calves.</p>

<p id="s62">§ 62. <i>Names of men.</i>&mdash;Wild Sage. Stands in a High and marshy place.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<h3 id="THE_TA-PA_OR_DEER-HEAD_GENS">THE [T]A-[P]A OR DEER-HEAD GENS.</h3>

<p id="s63">§ 63. The place of this gens in the tribal circle is after that of the
[T]e-sĭnde. The chief of the gens is Sĭnde-xa<sup>n</sup>xa<sup>n</sup>.</p>

<p><i>Taboo.</i>&mdash;The members of this gens cannot touch the skin of any animal
of the deer family; they cannot use moccasins of deer-skin; nor
can they use the fat of the deer for hair-oil, as the other Omahas can
do; but they can eat the flesh of the deer.</p>

<p><i>Subgentes.</i>&mdash;La Flèche and Two Crows recognized three divisions of
the gens for marriage purposes, and said that the Keepers of the Sacred
Pipe were "uʞa<sup>n</sup>ha jiñga," <i>a little apart from the rest</i>. Waniʇa-waqě,
who is himself the keeper of the Sacred Pipe of this gens, gave four
subgentes. These sat in the gentile circle in the following order: On
the first or left side of the "fire-place" were the Niniba t`a<sup>n</sup>, <i>Keepers of
the Pipe</i>, and Jiñga-gahige's subgens. On the other side were the
Thunder people and the real Deer people. The Keepers of the Pipe and
Jiñga-gahige's subgens seem to form one of the three divisions recognized
by La Flèche. Waniʇa-waqě said that his own subgens were
Eagle people, and that they had a special taboo, being forbidden to
touch verdigris (see [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze gens), charcoal, and the skin of the wild-cat.
He said that the members of the second subgens could not touch charcoal,
in addition to the general taboo of the gens. But La Flèche and
Two Crows said that none of the [T]a-[p]a could touch charcoal.</p>

<p>The head of the Niniba t`a<sup>n</sup> took the name Waniʇa-waqě, The Animal
that excels others, or Lion, after a visit to the East; but his real Omaha
name is Disobedient. [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-gahige is the head of the Thunder subgens,
and Sĭnde-xa<sup>n</sup>xa<sup>n</sup>, of the Deer subgens.</p>

<p id="s64">§ 64. <i>Birth-names for boys.</i>&mdash;Lion said that the following were some
of the Eagle birth-names of his subgens (see Iñke-sabě birth-names,
§ <a href="#s32">32</a>): The thunder-god makes the sound "ʇide" as he walks. Eagle
who is a chief (keeping a Sacred Pipe). Eagle that excels. White
Eagle (Golden Eagle). Akida-gahige, Chief who Watches over something
(being the keeper of a Sacred Pipe).</p>

<p>He gave the following as the Deer birth-names: He who Wags his
Tail. The Black Hair on the Abdomen of a Buck. Horns like phalanges.
Deer Paws the Ground, making parallel or diverging indentations.
Deer in the distance Shows its Tail White Suddenly. Little
Hoof of a deer. Dark Chin of a deer.</p>

<p id="s65">§ 65. <i>Ceremony on the fifth day after a birth.</i>&mdash;According to Lion, there
is a peculiar ceremony observed in his gens when an infant is named.
All the members of the gens assemble on the fifth day after the birth
of a child. Those belonging to the subgens of the infant cannot eat
anything cooked for the feast, but the men of the other subgentes are
at liberty to partake of the food. The infant is placed within the gentile
circle and the privileged decoration is made on the face of the child
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
with "wase-jide-nika," or Indian red. Then with the tips of the index,
middle, and the next finger, are red spots made down the child's back,
at short intervals, in imitation of a fawn. The child's breech-cloth (<i>sic</i>)
is also marked in a similar way. With the tips of three fingers are
rubbed stripes as long as a hand on the arms and chest of the infant.
All the [T]a-[p]a people, even the servants, decorate themselves. Rubbing
the rest of the Indian red on the palms of their hands, they pass their
hands backwards over their hair; and they finally make red spots on
their chests, about the size of a hand. The members of the Pipe subgens,
and those persons in the other subgentes who are related to the
infant's father through the calumet dance, are the only ones who are
allowed to use the privileged decoration, and to wear hi<sup>n</sup>qpe (<i>down</i>) in
their hair. If the infant belongs to the Pipe subgens, charcoal, verdigris,
and the skin of a wild-cat are placed beside him, as the articles
not to be touched by him in after-life. Then he is addressed thus: "This
you must not touch; this, too, you must not touch; and this you must
not touch." The verdigris symbolizes the blue sky.</p>

<p>La Flèche and Two Crows said that the custom is different from the
above. When a child is named on the fifth day after birth, all of the
gentiles are not invited, the only person who is called is an old man who
belongs to the subgens of the infant.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> He puts the spots on the child,
and gives it its name; but there is no breech-cloth.</p>

<p>Lion said that White Neck was the only servant in his gens at present.
When the gens assembled in its circle, the servants had to sit by
the door, as it was their place to bring in wood and water, and to wait
on the guests. La Flèche and Two Crows said that there were no servants
of this sort in any of the gentes.</p>

<p>Yet, among the Osages and Kansas, there are still two kinds of servants,
kettle-tenders and water-bringers. But these can be promoted to
the rank of brave men.</p>

<h3 id="THE_INGCE-JIDE_GENS">THE IÑG¢E-JIDE GENS.</h3>

<p id="s67">§ 67. The meaning of this name has been explained in several ways.
In Dougherty's Account of the Omahas (<i>Long's Expedition to the Rocky
Mountains</i>, I, 327) we read that "This name is said to have originated
from the circumstance of this band having formerly quarreled and
separated themselves from the nation, until, being nearly starved, they
were compelled to eat the fruit of the wild cherry tree, until their excrement
became red". (They must have eaten buffalo berries, not wild
cherries. La Flèche.) A<sup>n</sup>ba-hebe did not know the exact meaning of
the name, but said that it referred to the bloody body of the buffalo
seen when the seven old men visited this gens with the sacred pipes.
(See § <a href="#s16">16</a>). Two Crows said that the Iñg¢ejide men give the following
explanation: "[T]éjiñga ídai tědi, iñg¢é zí-jide éga<sup>n</sup>": <i>i. e.</i>, "When a
buffalo calf is born, its dung is a yellowish red."</p>

<p>The place of the Iñg¢e-jide in the tribal circle is next to that of the
[T]a-[p]a. Their head man is He-mu[s]nade.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

<p><i>Taboo.</i>&mdash;They do not eat a buffalo calf. (See [T]e-sĭnde gens.) It appears
that the two Ictasanda buffalo gentes are buffalo calf gentes, and that
the two Hañgacenu buffalo gentes are connected with the grown buffalo.</p>

<p><i>Decoration of skin tents.</i>&mdash;This consists of a circle painted on each side
of the entrance, within which is sketched the body of a buffalo calf,
visible from the flanks up. A similar sketch is made on the back of the
tent.</p>

<p id="s68">§ 68. <i>Birth names of boys.</i>&mdash;These are as follows, but their exact order
has not been gained: Buffalo calf. Seeks its Mother. Stands at the
End. Horn Erect with the sharp end toward the spectator. Buffalo
(calf?) Rolls over. Made dark by heat very suddenly. Ma<sup>n</sup>zeda<sup>n</sup>, meaning
unknown.</p>

<p><i>Subgentes.</i>&mdash;The Iñg¢e-jide are not divided for marriage purposes. Lion,
however, gave four subgentes; but he could not give the names and taboos.
He said that <i>Horn Erect</i> was the head of the first. The present
head of the second is <i>Little Star</i>. <i>Rolls over</i> is the head of the third;
and <i>Singer</i> of the fourth.</p>

<p><i>Names of men.</i>&mdash;Walking Buffalo. Buffalo Walks a little. (Buffaloes)
Continue Approaching. Tent-poles stuck Obliquely in the ground.
Becomes Cold suddenly. Hawk Temper. Bad Buffalo. (Buffalo calf)
Seeks its Mother. (Buffalo bull) Rolls over. Stands at the End.
Singer. Crow Skin. Small Bank. Kansas Head. Rapid (as a river).
Sacred Crow that speaks in Visions. White Feather. Walks at the
End.</p>

<p><i>Names of women.</i>&mdash;Moon-Hawk Female. Moon Horn Female. (Buffaloes)
Make the ground Striped as they run. Walks, seeking her own.</p>

<h3 id="THE_ICTASANDA_GENS">THE ICTASANDA GENS.</h3>

<p id="s69">§ 69. The meaning of "Ictasanda" is uncertain; though Say was told
by Dougherty that it signifies "gray eyes." It probably has some reference
to the effect of lightning on the eyes. The place of the Ictasanda
is at the end of the tribal circle, after the Iñg¢e-jide, and opposite to the
Weji<sup>n</sup>cte. The head of the gens is Ibaha<sup>n</sup>bi, son of Wanuʞige, and
grandson of Wacka<sup>n</sup>hi.</p>

<p><i>Taboo.</i>&mdash;The Ictasanda people do not touch worms, snakes, toads,
frogs, or any other kinds of reptiles. Hence they are sometimes called
the "Wag¢ícka níkaci<sup>n</sup>´ga," or Reptile people. But there are occasions
when they seem to violate this custom. If worms trouble the corn after
it has been planted, these people catch some of them. They pound
them up with a small quantity of grains of corn that have been heated.
They make a soup of the mixture and eat it, thinking that the corn will
not be troubled again&mdash;at least for the remainder of that season.</p>

<p id="s70">§ 70. <i>Birth names of boys.</i>&mdash;Ibaha<sup>n</sup>bi said that the first son was called
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
Gaagig¢e-hna<sup>n</sup>, which probably refers to thunder that is passing by. The
second is, The Thunder-god is Roaring as he Stands. The third, Big
Shoulder. The fourth, Walking Forked-lightning. The fifth, The thunder-god
Walks Roaring. The sixth, Sheet-lightning Makes a Glare inside
the Lodge. The seventh, The Thunder-god that Walks After others
at the close of a storm.</p>

<p><i>Birth names of girls.</i>&mdash;The first is called The Visible (Moon) in Motion.
The second, The Visible one that has Come back and is in a Horizontal
attitude. The third, Zizika-wate, meaning uncertain; refers to wild
turkeys. The fourth, Female (thunder?) who Roars. The fifth, She
who is Ever Coming back Visibly (referring to the moon?). The sixth,
White Eyed Female in the distance. The seventh, Visible ones in different
places.</p>

<p id="s71">§ 71. <i>Subgentes.</i>&mdash;For marriage purposes the gens is divided into
three parts, according to La Flèche and Two Crows. I. Niniba-t`a<sup>n</sup>,
Keepers of the Pipe, and Real Ictasanda, of which [T]e-uʞa<sup>n</sup>ha, [K]awaha,
Waji<sup>n</sup>-a<sup>n</sup>ba, and Si-¢ede-jiñga are the only survivors. II. Waceta<sup>n</sup>, or
Reptile people, under Ibaha<sup>n</sup>bi. III. Ing¢a<sup>n</sup>, Thunder people, among who
are Ui¢a<sup>n</sup>be-a<sup>n</sup>sa and Wanace-jiñga.</p>

<p>Lion divided the gens into four parts. I. Niniba-t`a<sup>n</sup>, under [T]e-uʞa<sup>n</sup>ha.
II. Real Ictasanda people, under Waji<sup>n</sup>-a<sup>n</sup>ba. III. Waceta<sup>n</sup> (referring
to the thunder, according to Lion, but denied by Two Crows), Reptile
people, under Ibaha<sup>n</sup>bi. These are sometimes called Keepers of the
Claws of the Wild-cat, because they bind these claws to the waist of a
new-born infant, putting them on the left side. IV. The Real Thunder
people are called, Those who do not touch the Clam shell, or, Keepers of
the Clam shell, or, Keepers of the Clam shell and the Tooth of a Black
bear. These bind a clam shell to the waist of a child belonging to this
subgens, when he is forward in learning to walk. (See §§ <a href="#s24">24</a>, <a href="#s43">43</a>, <a href="#s45">45</a>,
and <a href="#s63">63</a>.)</p>

<p>At the time that Waniʇa-waqě gave this information, March, 1880, he
said that there were but two men left in the Niniba-t`a<sup>n</sup>, [T]e-uʞa<sup>n</sup>ha, and
[K]awaha. Now it appears that they have united with Waji<sup>n</sup>-a<sup>n</sup>ba and
Si¢ede-jiñga, the survivors of the Ictasandaqti. [T]e-uʞa<sup>n</sup>ha, being the
keeper of the Ictasanda sacred pipe, holds what was a very important
office, that of being the person who has the right to fill the sacred pipes
for the chiefs. (See §§ <a href="#s17">17</a> and <a href="#s18">18</a>.) [T]e-uʞa<sup>n</sup>ha, does not, however,
know the sacred words used on such occasions, as his father, Mahi<sup>n</sup>zi,
died without communicating them to him.</p>

<p>But some say that there is another duty devolving on this keeper.
There has been a custom in the tribe not to cut the hair of children
when they were small, even after they began to walk. But before a
child reached the age of four years, it was necessary for it to be taken,
with such other children as had not had their hair cut, to the man who
filled the sacred pipes. Two or three old men of the Ictasanda gens sat
together on that occasion. They sent a crier around the camp or village,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
saying, "You who wish to have your children's hair cut bring
them." Then the father, or else the mother, would take the child, with
a pair of good moccasins for the child to put on, also a present for the
keeper of the sacred pipe, which might consist of a pair of moccasins,
some arrows, or a dress, etc. When the parents had arrived with their
children each one addressed the keeper of the pipe, saying, "Venerable
man, you will please cut my child's hair," handing him the present at
the same time. Then the old man would take a child, cut off one lock
about the length of a finger, tie it up, and put it with the rest in a
sacred buffalo hide. Then the old man put the little moccasins on the
child, who had not worn any previously, and after turning him around
four times he addressed him thus: "[T]ucpáha, Wakan´da ¢a`é¢i¢é-de
ʞáci ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñ´ka si á¢ag¢é taté&mdash;<i>Grandchild, may Wakanda pity you, and
may your feet rest for a long time on the ground!</i>" Another form of the
address was this: "Wakan´da ¢a`é¢i¢e taté! Ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñ´ka si á¢ag¢é taté.
Gúdihéga<sup>n</sup> hné taté!&mdash;<i>May Wakanda pity you! May your feet tread the
ground! May you go ahead</i> (<i>i. e.</i>, may you live hereafter)!" At the
conclusion of the ceremony the parent took the child home, and on
arriving there the father cut off the rest of the child's hair, according to
the style of the gens. La Flèche told the following, in 1879: "If it was
desired, horns were left, and a circle of hair around the head, with one
lock at each side, over the ear. Some say that they cut off more of the
hair, leaving none on top and only a circle around the head." But the
writer has not been able to ascertain whether this referred to any particular
gens, as the Ictasanda or to the whole tribe. "It is the duty of
Waji<sup>n</sup>-a<sup>n</sup>ba, of the Real Ictasanda, to cut the children's hair. The
Keepers of the Pipe and the Real Ictasanda were distinct subgentes,
each having special duties." (<i>Frank La Flèche.</i>)</p>

<p id="s72">§ 72. <i>Names of men.</i>&mdash;[T]e-uʞa<sup>n</sup>ha (Sentinel Buffalo Apart from the
herd) and his brother, [K]awaha, are the only survivors of the <i>Keepers of
the Pipe</i>. Hañga-cenu and Mahi<sup>n</sup>-zi (Yellow Rock) are dead.</p>

<p>II. <i>Real Ictasanda people.</i>&mdash;Waji<sup>n</sup>-a<sup>n</sup>ba and Small Heel are the only

<small>THE KINSHIP SYSTEM AND MARRIAGE LAWS.</small></h2>

<h3 id="CLASSES_OF_KINSHIP">CLASSES OF KINSHIP.</h3>

<p id="s73">§ 73. Joseph La Flèche and Two Crows recognize four classes of kinship:</p>

<p>1. Consanguineous or blood kinship, which includes not only the gens
of the father, but also those of the mother and grandmothers.</p>

<p>2. Marriage kinship, including all the affinities of the consort, as well
as those of the son's wife or daughter's husband.</p>

<p>3. Weawa<sup>n</sup> kinship, connected with the Calumet dance. (See § <a href="#s126">126</a>.)</p>

<p>4. Inter-gentile kinship, existing between contiguous gentes. This
last is not regarded as a bar to intermarriage, <i>e. g.</i>, the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte and
Iñke-sabě gentes are related; and the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte man whose tent is at the
end of his gentile area in the tribal circle is considered as a very near
kinsman by the Iñke-sabě man whose tent is next to his. In like manner,
the Iñke-sabě Wa¢igije man who camps next to the Hañga gens is a brother
of his nearest Hañga neighbor. The last man in the Hañga area is the
brother of the first ₵atada (Wasabe-hit`ajĭ), who acts as Quʞa for the
Hañga. The last ₵atada [K]e-`i<sup>n</sup> man is brother of the first [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze man,
and so on around the circle.</p>

<p>Two other classes of relationship were given to the writer by members
of three tribes, Omahas, Ponkas, and Missouris, but Joseph La
Flèche and Two Crows never heard of them. The writer gives authorities
for each statement.</p>

<p>5. Nikie kinship. "Nikie" means "Something handed down from
a mythical ancestor," or "An ancient custom." Nikie kinship refers to
kinship based on descent from the same or a similar mythical ancestor.
For example, Big Elk, of the Omaha Weji<sup>n</sup>cte or Elk gens, told the
writer that he was related to the Kansas Elk gens, and that a Weji<sup>n</sup>cte
man called a Kansas Elk man "My younger brother," the Kansas man
calling the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte "My elder brother."</p>

<p>Icta¢abi, an Iñke-sabě, and Ckátce-yiñ´e, of the Missouri tribe, said
that the Omaha Weji<sup>n</sup>cte calls the Oto Hótatci (Elk gens) "Elder
brother." But Big Elk did not know about this. He said, however,
that his gens was related to the Ponka Niʞa[p]aᴐna, a deer and elk gens.</p>

<p>Icta¢abi said that Omaha Iñke-sabě, his own gens, calls the Ponka
₵ixida "Grandchild"; but others say that this is owing to intermarriage.
Icta¢abi also said that Iñke-sabě calls the Ponka Wajaje "Elder
brother"; but some say that this is owing to intermarriage. Gahige,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
of the Iñke-sabě gens, calls Standing Grizzly bear of the Ponka Wajaje
his grandchild; and Standing Buffalo, of the same gens, his son. So
Icta¢abi's statement was incorrect.</p>

<p>Icta¢bi and Ckatce-yiñe said that Iñke-sabě calls the Oto Arúqwa,

is called "Grandchild" by Iñke-sabě.</p>

<p>Some said that the Omaha Wasabe-hit`ajĭ called the Ponka Wasabe-hit`ajĭ
"Grandchild"; but [P]á¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pájĭ, of the Omaha Wasabe-hit`ajĭ, said
that his subgens called the Ponka Wasabe-hit`ajĭ "Younger brother";
and ₵ixida and Wajaje "Grandfather." Húpe¢a, another member of the
Omaha Wasabe-hit`ajĭ, said that Ubísk&#259; of the Ponka Wasabe-hit`ajĭ was
his son; Ubísk&#259;'s father, his elder brother (by marriage); and Ubísk&#259;'s
grandfather his (Hupe¢a's) father. He also said that he addressed as
elder brothers all Ponka men older than himself, and all younger than
himself he called his younger brothers.</p>

<p>Fire Chief of the Omaha Wajiñga-¢atajĭ said that he called Keʞré[ç]e,

<p>[T]a-[p]a calls Oto [T]ᴐéxita (Eagle people) "Grandchildren"; and Ponka
Hísada "Grandfathers."</p>

<p>Icta¢abi said that Ictasanda called Ponka Maka<sup>n</sup>´ "Mother's brother";
but Ibaha<sup>n</sup>bi, of the Ictasanda gens, denied it. Ibaha<sup>n</sup>bi said that he
called a member of a gens of another tribe, when related to him by the
nikie, "My father," if the latter were very old; "My elder brother," if
a little older than himself, and "My younger brother," if the latter were
Ibaha<sup>n</sup>bi's junior. Besides, Ibaha<sup>n</sup>bi takes, for example, the place of
Standing Bear of the Ponka Wajaje; and whatever relationship Standing
Bear sustains to the Hisada, ₵ixida, Nikadaᴐna, etc., is also sustained
to the members of each gens by Ibaha<sup>n</sup>bi.</p>

<p>6. Sacred Pipe kinship. Gahige, of the Omaha Iñke-sabě, said that
all who had sacred pipes called one another "Friend." Ponka Wacabe
and Omaha Iñke-sabě speak to each other thus. But Joseph La Flèche
and Two Crows deny this.</p>

<h4 id="CONSANGUINEOUS_KINSHIP">CONSANGUINEOUS KINSHIP.</h4>

<p id="s74">§ 74. All of a man's consanguinities belong to fourteen groups, and a
woman has fifteen groups of consanguinities. Many affinities are addressed
by consanguinity terms; excepting these, there are only four
groups of affinities. In the accompanying charts consanguinities are
designated by capital letters and affinities by small letters. Roman letters
denote males and script letters females. Some necessary exceptions
to these rules are shown in the Legends.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<p id="s75">§ 75. <i>Peculiarities of the Charts.</i>&mdash;The most remote ancestors are called
grandfathers and grandmothers, and the most remote descendant is addressed
or spoken of as a grandchild.</p>

<p>My brother's children (male speaking) are my children, because their
mother ([J]) can become my wife on the death of their father. My
brother's son (I) and daughter ([b]), [b] female speaking, are my nephews
and nieces. A man calls his sister's children his nephews and nieces (G
and [G]), and they do not belong to his gens.</p>

<p>A woman calls her sister's children, her own children, as their father
can be her husband. (See "e.") My mother's brother's son (m. or f. sp.)
is my mother's brother (H), because his sister ([A]) can be my father's
wife. The son of an "H" is always an "H" and his sisters and daughters
are always "[A]'s." The children of [A]'s are always brothers
and sisters to Ego (m. or f.), as are the children of A's. The husband of
my father's sister (m. sp.) is my brother-in-law (a) because he can marry
my sister ([E] or [F]), and their children are my sister's children (G
and "[G]"). A brother of the real or potential wife of a grandfather is
also a grandfather of Ego (m. or f.). The niece of the real or potential
wife of my grandfather (m. or f. sp.) is his potential wife and my grandmother,
so her brother is my grandfather.</p>

<p id="s76">§ 76. From these examples and from others found in the charts, it is
plain that the kinship terms are used with considerable latitude, and not
as we employ them. Whether Ego be a male or female, I call all men
my fathers whom my father calls his brothers or whom my mother calls
her potential husbands. I call all women my mothers whom my mother
calls her sisters, aunts, or nieces, or whom my father calls his potential
wives.</p>

<p>I call all men brothers who are the sons of such fathers or mothers,
and their sisters are my sisters. I call all men my grandfathers who
are the fathers or grandfathers of my fathers or mothers, or whom my
fathers or mothers call their mothers' brothers. I call all women my
grandmothers who are the real or potential wives of my grandfathers,
or who are the mothers or grandmothers of my fathers or mothers, or
whom my fathers or mothers call their fathers' sisters.</p>

<p>I, a male, call all males my sons who are the sons of my brothers or
of my potential wives, and the sisters of those sons are my daughters.
I, a female, call those males my nephews who are the sons of my
brothers, and the daughters of my brothers are my nieces; but my sister's
children are my children as their father is my potential or actual
husband. I, a male, call my sister's son my nephew, and her daughter
is my niece. I, a male or female, call all males and females my grandchildren
who are the children of my sons, daughters, nephews, or nieces.
I, a male or female, call all men my uncles whom my mothers call their
brothers. And my aunts are all females who are my fathers' sisters as
well as those who are the wives of my uncles. But my father's sisters'
husbands, I being a male, are my brothers-in-law, being the potential
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
or real husbands of my sisters; and they are my potential husbands,
when Ego is a female.</p>

<p id="s77">§ 77. Any female is the potential wife of Ego, a male, whom my own

a male, also call my potential wives those who the widows or wives of
my elder or younger brothers.</p>

<p>I, a male, have any male for my brother-in-law whom my wife calls her
elder or younger brother; also any male who is the brother of my wife's
niece or of my brother's wife. But my wife's father's brother is my
grandfather, not my brother-in-law, though his sister is my potential
wife. When my brother-in-law is the husband of my father's sister or
of my own sister, his sister is my grandchild, and not my potential wife.
A man is my brother-in-law if he be the husband of my father's sister,
since he can marry my own sister, but my aunt's husband is not my
brother-in-law when he is my uncle or mother's brother (H). Any male
is my brother-in-law who is my sister's husband (a). But while my sister's
niece's husband is my sister's potential or real husband, he is my
son-in-law, as he is my daughter's husband (d). I, a male or female,

<p>Any female is my daughter-in-law (male or female speaking) who is
the wife of my son, nephew, or grandchild; and the mother of my son-in-law

who is the father, mother's brother, or grandfather of my wife,
my potential wife, or my daughter-in-law (the last being the wife of my

<h3 id="MARRIAGE_LAWS">MARRIAGE LAWS.</h3>

<p id="s78">§ 78. A man must marry outside of his gens. Two Crows, of the Hañga
gens, married a Weji<sup>n</sup>cte woman; his father married a [T]e-sĭnde woman;
his paternal grandfather, a Hañga man, married a Wasabe-hit`ajĭ woman;
and his maternal grandfather, a [T]e-sĭnde man, married a [T]e-[p]a-it`ajĭ
woman. His son, Gai<sup>n</sup>´-bajĭ, a Hañga, married an Iñke-sabě woman;
and his daughter, a Hañga, married Qi¢á-gahíge, a [T]a-[p]a man.
Caa<sup>n</sup>´, a brother of Two Crows, and a Hañga, married a [T]a[p]a woman, a
daughter of the chief Sĭn´ac-xa<sup>n</sup>´xa<sup>n</sup>. Another brother, Mi<sup>n</sup>xá-ta<sup>n</sup>, also
a Hañga, married a [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze woman.</p>

<p>Joseph La Flèche's mother was a Ponka Wasabe-hit`ajĭ woman; hence
he belongs to that Ponka gens. His maternal grandfather, a Ponka
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
Wasabe-hit`ajĭ, married a Ponka Wajaje woman. Her father, a Wajaje,
married a Ponka Maka<sup>n</sup> woman.</p>

<p>Two Crows, being a Hañga, cannot marry a Hañga woman, nor can
he marry a [T]e-sĭnde woman, as they are all his kindred through his
mother. He cannot marry women belonging to the Wasabe-hit`ajĭ and
[T]e-[p]a-it`ajĭ subgentes ("uʞig¢a[s]ne") of the ₵atada gens, because his
real grandmothers belonged to those subgentes. But he can marry
women belonging to the other ₵atada subgentes, the Wajiñga-¢atajĭ
and [K]e-`i<sup>n</sup>, as they are not his kindred. In like manner Joseph La
Flèche cannot marry a Ponka Wasabe-hit`ajĭ woman, a Ponka Wajaje
woman, or a Ponka Maka<sup>n</sup> woman. But he can marry an Omaha Wasabe-hit`ajĭ
woman, as she belongs to another tribe.</p>

<p>Gai<sup>n</sup>-bajĭ cannot marry women belonging to the following gentes:
Hañga (his father's gens), Weji<sup>n</sup>cte (his mother's gens), [T]e-sĭnde (his
paternal grandmother's gens), Wasabe-hit`ajĭ, and [T]e-[p]a-it`ajĭ.</p>

<p>Gai<sup>n</sup>-bajĭ's son cannot marry any women belonging to the following
gentes: Iñke-sabě, Hañga, Weji<sup>n</sup>cte, [T]e-sĭnde, or that of the mother of
his mother. Nor could he marry a Wasabe-hit`ajĭ or [T]e-[p]a-it`ajĭ woman,
if his parents or grandparents were living, and knew the degree
of kinship. But if they were dead, and he was ignorant of the fact
that the women and he were related, he might marry one or more of
them. The same rule holds good for the marriage of Qi¢a-gahige's son,
but with the substitution of [T]a-[p]a for Iñke-sabě.</p>

<p>Two Crows cannot marry any Iñke-sabě woman belonging to the
subgens of his son's wife; but he can marry one belonging to either
of the remaining subgentes. So, too, he cannot marry a [T]a-[p]a woman
belonging to the subgens of Qi¢a-gahige, his son-in-law, but he
can marry any other [T]a-[p]a woman. As his brother Caa<sup>n</sup>, had married
a [T]a-[p]a woman of Sĭnde-xa<sup>n</sup>xa<sup>n</sup>'s subgens, Two Crows has a right to
marry any [T]a-[p]a woman of her subgens who was her sister, father's
sister, or brother's daughter. He has a similar privilege in the [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze
gens, owing to the marriage of another brother, Mi<sup>n</sup>xa-ta<sup>n</sup>.</p>

<p>An Omaha Hañga man can marry a Kansas Hañga woman, because
she belongs to another tribe. A Ponka Wasabe-hit`ajĭ man can marry
an Omaha Wasabe-hit`ajĭ woman, because she belongs to a different
tribe.</p>

<h4 id="WHOM_A_MAN_OR_WOMAN_CANNOT_MARRY">WHOM A MAN OR WOMAN CANNOT MARRY.</h4>

<p>A man cannot marry any of the women of the gens of his father, as
they are his grandmothers, aunts, sisters, nieces, daughters, or grandchildren.
He cannot marry any woman of the subgens of his father's
mother, for the same reason; but he can marry any woman belonging
to the other subgentes of his paternal grandmother's gens, as they are
not his kindred. The women of the subgens of his paternal grandmother's
mother are also forbidden to him; but those of the remaining
subgentes of that gens can become his wives, provided they are such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
as have not become his mothers-in-law, daughters, or grandchildren.
(See § <a href="#s7">7</a>, <a href="#s126">126</a>, etc.)</p>

<p>A man cannot marry any women of his mother's gens, nor any of his
maternal grandmother's subgens, nor any of the subgens of her mother,
as all are his consanguinities.</p>

<p>A man cannot marry a woman of the subgens of the wife of his son,
nephew, or grandson; nor can he marry a woman of the subgens of
the husband of his daughter, niece, or granddaughter.</p>

<p>A man cannot marry any of his female affinities who are his iʞa<sup>n</sup>, because
they are the real or potential wives of his fathers-in-law, or of
the fathers-in-law of his sons, nephews, or grandchildren.</p>

<p>A man cannot marry any woman whom he calls his sister's daughter.
He cannot marry any woman whom he calls his grandchild. This includes
his wife's sister's daughter's daughter.</p>

<p>He cannot marry the daughter of any woman who is his ihañga, as
such a daughter he calls his daughter.</p>

<p>He cannot marry his sister's husband's sister, for she is his iʇucpa.
He cannot marry his sister's husband's father's brother's daughter, as
she is his iʇucpa; nor can he marry her daughter or her brother's daughter,
for the same reason. He cannot marry his sister's husband's (brother's)
daughter, as she is his sister's potential daughter, and he calls her
his iʇija<sup>n</sup>.</p>

<p>A woman cannot marry her son, the son of her sister, aunt, or niece;
her grandson, the grandson of her sister, aunt, or niece; any man whom
she calls elder or younger brother; any man whom she calls her father's
or mother's brother; her iʇijiga<sup>n</sup> (including her consanguinities, her father-in-law,
her brother's wife's brother, her brother's wife's father, her brother's
son's wife's father, her brother's wife's brother's son, her father's
brother's son's wife's brother, her grandfather's brother's son's wife's
brother); or any man who is her iʇande.</p>

<h4 id="WHOM_A_MAN_OR_WOMAN_CAN_MARRY">WHOM A MAN OR WOMAN CAN MARRY.</h4>

<p>A man can marry a woman of the gens of his grandmother, paternal
or maternal, if the woman belong to another subgens. He can marry
a woman of the gens of his grandmother's mother, if the latter belong
to another subgens, or if he be ignorant of her kinship to himself.</p>

<p>He can marry a woman of another tribe, even when she belongs to a
gens corresponding to his own, as she is not a real kinswoman.</p>

<p>He can marry any woman, not his consanguinity, if she be not among
the forbidden affinities. He can marry any of his affinities who is his
ihañga, being the ija<sup>n</sup>¢e, iʇañge, iʇimi, or iʇujañge of his wife. And vice
versa, any woman can marry a man who is the husband of her ija<sup>n</sup>¢e,
iʇañge, iʇimi, or iʇujañge. If a man has several kindred whom he calls
his brothers, and his wife has several female relations who are his
ihañga, the men and women can intermarry.

<h4 id="IMPORTANCE_OF_THE_SUBGENTES">IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBGENTES.</h4>

<p>Were it not for the institution of subgentes a man would be compelled
to marry outside of his tribe, as all the women would be his kindred,
owing to previous intermarriages between the ten gentes. But in
any gens those on the other side of the gentile "une¢e," or fire-place,
are not reckoned as full kindred, though they cannot intermarry.</p>

<p id="s79">§ 79. A man takes the widow of his real or potential brother in order
to become the stepfather (i¢adi jiñga, <i>little father</i>) of his brother's children.
Should the widow marry a stranger he might hate the children,
and the kindred of the deceased husband do not wish her to take the
children so far away from them. Sometimes the stepfather takes the
children without their mother, if she be maleficent. Sometimes the
dying husband knows that his kindred are bad, so he tells his wife to
marry out of his gens. When the wife is dying she may say to her
brother, "Pity your brother-in-law. Let him marry my sister."

<h3 id="COURTSHIP_AND_MARRIAGE_CUSTOMS">COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE CUSTOMS.</h3>

<p id="s80">§ 80. <i>Age of puberty and marriage.</i>&mdash;It is now customary for girls to
be married at the age of fifteen, sixteen, or seventeen years among the
Omahas, and in the Ponka tribe they generally take husbands as soon
as they enter their fifteenth year. It was not so formerly; men waited
till they were twenty-five or thirty, and the women till they were twenty
years of age. Then, when a consort was spoken of they used to refer
the matter to their friends, who discussed the characters of the parties,
and advised accordingly, as they proved good (<i>i. e.</i>, industrious and
good-tempered, and having good kindred) or bad. Sometimes an Omaha
girl is married at the age of fourteen or fifteen; but in such a case her
husband waits about a year for the consummation of the marriage.
When a girl matures rapidly she is generally married when she is sixteen;
but those who are slow to mature marry when they reach seventeen.
(See § <a href="#s97">97</a>.)</p>

<p>Dougherty states (in <i>Long's Expedition to the Rocky Mountains</i>, vol.
1, p. 230) that "In the Omawhaw nation numbers of females are betrothed
in marriage from their infancy. * * * Between the ages
of nine and twelve years the young wife is occasionally an invited visitant
at the lodge of her husband, in order that she may become familiarized
with his company and his bed." But such is not the case among
the Omahas according to La Flèche and Two Crows, who say that
Dougherty referred to a Kansas custom.</p>

<p id="s81">§ 81. <i>Courtship.</i>&mdash;The men court the women either directly or by
proxy. The women used to weigh the matter well, but now they hasten
to marry any man that they can get. Sometimes the girl told her
kindred and obtained their advice. Parents do not force their daughters
to marry against their will. Sometimes a girl refuses to marry the
man, and the parents cannot compel her to take him. All that they can
do is to give her advice: "Here is a good young man. We desire you
to marry him." Or they may say to the people, "We have a single
daughter, and it is our wish to get her married." Then the men go to
court her. Should the parents think that the suitor is not apt to make
her a good husband they return his presents. Suitors may curry favor
with parents and kindred of the girl by making presents to them, but
parents do not sell their daughters. The presents made for such a purpose
are generally given by some old man who wishes to get a very
young girl whom he is doubtful of winning. When a man courts the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
girl directly this is unnecessary. Then he gives what he pleases to her
kindred, and sometimes they make presents to him.</p>

<p>When men reach the age of forty years without having courted any
one the women generally dislike them, and refuse to listen to them.
The only exception is when the suitor is beneficent. Such a man gets
his father to call four old men, by whom he sends four horses to the
lodge of the girl's father. If the latter consents and the girl be willing
he consults his kindred, and sends his daughter, with four horses from
his own herd, to the lodge of the suitor's father. The latter often calls
a feast, to which he invites the kindred of the girl, as well as those of
his son. When the girl is sent away by her parents she is placed on one
of the horses, which is led by an old man. There is not always a feast,
and there is no regular marriage ceremony.</p>

<p>A man of twenty-five or thirty will court a girl for two or three years.
Sometimes the girl pretends to be unwilling to marry him, just to try
his love, but at last she usually consents.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when a youth sees a girl whom he loves, if she be willing,
he says to her, "I will stand in that place. Please go thither at night."
Then after her arrival he enjoys her, and subsequently asks her of her
father in marriage. But it was different with a girl who had been
petulant, one who had refused to listen to the suitor at first. He might
be inclined to take his revenge. After lying with her, he might say,
"As you struck me and hurt me, I will not marry you. Though you
think much of yourself, I despise you." Then would she be sent away
without winning him for her husband; and it was customary for the
man to make songs about her. In these songs the woman's name was
not mentioned unless she had been a "mi<sup>n</sup>ckeda," or dissolute woman.</p>

<p>One day in 1872, when the writer was on the Ponka Reservation in
Dakota, he noticed several young men on horseback, who were waiting
for a young girl to leave the Mission house. He learned that they were
her suitors, and that they intended to run a race with her after they
dismounted. Whoever could catch her would marry her; but she would
take care not to let the wrong one catch her. La Flèche and Two
Crows maintain that this is not a regular Ponka custom, and they are
sure that the girl (a widow) must have been a "mi<sup>n</sup>ckeda."</p>

<p id="s82">§ 82. <i>Marriage by elopement.</i>&mdash;Sometimes a man elopes with a woman.
Her kindred have no cause for anger if the man takes the woman as
his wife. Should a man get angry because his single daughter, sister,
or niece had eloped, the other Omahas would talk about him, saying,
"That man is angry on account of the elopement of his daughter!"
They would ridicule him for his behavior. La Flèche knew of but one
case, and that a recent one, in which a man showed anger on such an
occasion. But if the woman had been taken from her husband by another
man her kindred had a right to be angry. Whether the woman
belongs to the same tribe or to another the man can elope with her if
she consents. The Omahas cannot understand how marriage by capture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
could take place, as the woman would be sure to alarm her people
by her cries.</p>

<p id="s83">§ 83. <i>Customs subsequent to marriage.</i>&mdash;Sometimes the kindred of the
husband are assembled by his father, who addresses them, saying,
"My son's wife misses her old home. Collect gifts, and let her take
them to her kindred." Then the husband's kindred present to the wife
horses, food, etc., and the husband's mother tells her daughter-in-law
to take the gifts to her parents. When the husband and wife reach
the lodge of the wife's parents the father calls his daughter's kindred
to a feast and distributes the presents among them. By and by, perhaps
a year later, the wife's kindred may assemble and tell the husband
to take presents and food to his kindred, especially if the latter be poor.
This custom is now obsolescent.</p>

<p id="s84">§ 84. <i>Polygamy.</i>&mdash;The maximum number of wives that one man can
have is three, <i>e. g.</i>, the first wife, her aunt, and her sister or niece, if all
be consanguinities. Sometimes the three are not kindred.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>When a man wishes to take a second wife he always consults his first
wife, reasoning thus with her: "I wish you to have less work to do, so
I think of taking your sister, your aunt, or your brother's daughter for
my wife. You can then have her to aid you with your work." Should
the first wife refuse the man cannot marry the other woman. Generally
no objection is offered, especially if the second woman be one of
the kindred of the first wife.</p>

<p>Sometimes the wife will make the proposition to her husband, "I
wish you to marry my brother's daughter, as she and I are one flesh."
Instead of "brother's daughter," she may say her sister or her aunt.</p>

<p>The first wife is never deposed. She always retains the right to manage
household affairs, and she controls the distribution of food, etc.,
giving to the other wives what she thinks they should receive.</p>

<p id="s85">§ 85. If a man has a wife who is active and skillful at dressing hides,
etc., and the other wives are lazy or unskillful, he leaves them with
their parents or other kindred, and takes the former wife with him when
he goes with the tribe on the buffalo hunt. Sometimes he will leave this
wife a while to visit one of his other wives. But Dougherty was misinformed
when he was told that the skillful wife would be apt to show
her jealousy by "knocking the dog over with a club, repulsing her own
child, kicking the fire about, pulling the bed, etc." (see p. 232, Vol. I,
<i>Long's Expedition to the Rocky Mountains</i>), for when a wife is jealous she
scolds or strikes her husband or else she tries to hit the other woman.</p>

<p><i>Polyandry.</i>&mdash;The Omahas say that this has not been practiced among
them, nor do the Ponkas know this custom. But the terms of kinship
seem to point to an age when it was practiced.</p>

<p id="s86">§ 86. <i>Permanence of marriage.</i>&mdash;Among the Santee Dakotas, where
mother-right prevails(?), a wife's mother can take her from the husband
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
and give her to another man. Among the ₵egiha, if the husband is
kind, the mother-in-law never interferes. But when the husband is
unkind the wife takes herself back, saying to him, "I have had you
for my husband long enough; depart." Sometimes the father or elder
brother of the woman says to the husband, "You have made her suffer;
you shall not have her for a wife any longer." This they do when he
has beaten her several times, or has been cruel in other ways. But
sometimes the woman has married the man in spite of the warnings of
her kindred, who have said to her, "He is maleficent; do not take him
for your husband." When such a woman repents, and wishes to abandon
her husband, her male kindred say to her, "Not so; still have him
for your husband; remain with him always." Thus do they punish her
for not having heeded their previous warnings. When they are satisfied
with each other they always stay together; but should either one
turn out bad, the other one always wishes to abandon the unworthy
consort.</p>

<p>When parents separate, the children are sometimes taken by their
mother, and sometimes by her mother or their father's mother. Should
the husband be unwilling, the wife cannot take the children with her.
Each consort can remarry. Sometimes one consort does not care whether
the other one marries again or not; but occasionally the divorced wife
or husband gets angry on hearing of the remarriage of the other.</p>

<h3 id="DOMESTIC_ETIQUETTE-BASHFULNESS">DOMESTIC ETIQUETTE&mdash;BASHFULNESS.</h3>

<p id="s87">§ 87. A man does not speak to his wife's mother or grandmother; he
and she are ashamed to speak to each other. But should his wife be
absent he sometimes asks her mother for information, if there be no
one present through whom he can inquire.</p>

<p>In former days it was always the rule for a man not to speak to his
wife's parents or grandparents. He was obliged to converse with them
through his wife or child, by addressing the latter and requesting him
or her to ask the grandparent for the desired information. Then the
grandparent used to tell the man's wife or child to say so and so to the
man. In like manner a woman cannot speak directly to her husband's
father under ordinary circumstances. They must resort to the medium
of a third party, the woman's husband or child. But if the husband
and child be absent, the woman or her father-in-law is obliged to make
the necessary inquiry.</p>

<p>A woman never passes in front of her daughter's husband if she can
avoid it. The son-in-law tries to avoid entering a place where there is
no one but his mother-in-law. When at the Ponka mission, in Dakota,
the writer noticed the Ponka chief, Standing Buffalo, one day when he
entered the school-room. When he saw that his mother-in-law was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
seated there, he turned around very quickly, threw his blanket over
his head, and went into another part of the house.</p>

<p>Another custom prevails, which Dougherty described thus: "If a
person enters a dwelling in which his son-in-law is seated, the latter
turns his back, and avails himself of the first opportunity to leave the
premises. If a person visits his wife during her residence at the lodge
of her father, the latter averts himself, and conceals his head with his
robe, and his hospitality is extended circuitously by means of his daughter,
by whom the pipe is transferred to her husband to smoke." He also
said that if the mother-in-law wished to present her son-in-law with
food, it was invariably handed to the daughter for him; and if the
daughter should be absent, the mother-in-law placed the food on the
ground, and retired from the lodge that he might take it up and eat it."
(<i>Long's Expedition to the Rocky Mountains</i>, Vol. I, pp. 253, 254.) The
Dakotas have this custom and call it "wiśtenkiyapi."</p>

<h3 id="PREGNANCY">PREGNANCY.</h3>

<p id="s88">§ 88. The woman, when she perceives that the catamenia does not
recur at the expected period, begins to reckon her pregnancy from the
last time that she "dwelt alone." As the months pass, she says, "Mi<sup>n</sup>´
gána b¢i<sup>n</sup>´," <i>I am that number of months</i> (with child). If she cannot tell
the exact number of months, she asks her husband or some old man to
count for her. At other times, it is the husband who asks the old man.
They calculate from the last time that the woman "dwelt alone."</p>

<p>Dougherty says that he did not hear of any case of "longing, or of
nausea of the stomach, during pregnancy."</p>

<p id="s89">§ 89. <i>Couvade, F&oelig;ticide, and Infanticide.</i>&mdash;Couvade is not practiced
among the ₵egiha. F&oelig;ticide is uncommon. About twenty-two years
ago, Standing Hawk's wife became <i>enceinte</i>. He said to her, "It is bad
for you to have a child. Kill it." She asked her mother for medicine.
The mother made it, and gave it to her. The child was still-born. The
daughter of Wacka<sup>n</sup>-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup> used to be very dissolute, and whenever
she was pregnant she killed the child before birth. These are exceptional
cases; for they are very fond of their children, and are anxious
to have them. Infanticide is not known among them.</p>

<p id="s90">§ 90. <i>Accouchement.</i>&mdash;The husband and his children go to another
lodge, as no man must witness the birth. Only two or three old women
attend to the patient. In some cases, if the patient be strong, she
"takes" the child herself, but requires assistance subsequently. Should
the woman continue in pain for two or three days without delivery, a
doctor is sent for, and he comes with a medicine that is very bitter.
He departs as soon as he has caused the patient to drink the medicine.
There are about two or three Omahas who know this medicine, which
is called Niaci<sup>n</sup>ga maka<sup>n</sup>, <i>Human-being medicine</i>. The writer saw one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
of these roots at the Kaw Agency, Indian Territory. It is used by
the Kansas. The doctor never comes of his own accord. After having
given this medicine two or three times without success, he says, "I
have failed, send for some one else." Then another doctor comes, and
tries his medicine. Very few Omaha girls die in child-bed.</p>

<p>After delivery the patient is bound tightly about the abdomen, to
reduce the size, as is the custom among civilized nations. Then is she
washed in cool water if it be summer time, but in tepid water if it be
cold weather. She must bathe twice a day. Mr. Hamilton was told
that "the flow of blood ceased then to a great extent, especially after a
few days; seldom lasting beyond ten days." La Flèche said that the
women do not tell about the cessation of the flow. When the woman
is strong she may go to work on the following day; but if she be weak
she may require a fortnight or three weeks for recovering her strength.</p>

<p>When the husband asks about the infant, and they reply "It is a
boy," or "It is a girl," he is very glad. Sometimes the husband treats
a girl infant better than a boy, saying, "She cannot get anything for herself,
whereas a son can take care of himself, as he is strong." Mr. Hamilton
says, "I have heard of cases of severe labor. Women act as
midwives, and with some skill, removing the placenta when adhering
to the uterus, and in the usual manner."</p>

<p>Soon after birth the child is washed all over, wrapped in clothes,
which are bound loosely around it. About two or three days after birth
the infant's father or grandfather gives it a name, which is not always
a nikie name. (See the account of the ceremony in the [T]a[p]a gens,
when a child is four days old, § <a href="#s65">65</a>.) Sometimes it is put into the
cradle or board in two or three days; sometimes in about a week.</p>

<p><i>Nursing.</i>&mdash;Another woman serves as wet-nurse till the mother's
breasts are full of milk. Mammary abscess is very rare.</p>

<p id="s91">§ 91. <i>Number of children.</i>&mdash;In 1819-'20 Dougherty wrote thus: "Sterility,
although it does occur, is not frequent, and seems to be mostly
attributable to the husband, as is evinced by subsequent marriages
of the squaws. The usual number of children may be stated at from
four to six in a family, but in some families there are ten or twelve.
Of these the mother has often two at the breast simultaneously, of
which one may be three years of age. At this age, however, and
sometimes rather earlier, the child is weaned by the aid of ridicule,
in which the parents are assisted by visitors." In 1882 La Flèche and
Two Crows declared that there are many cases of barrenness. Children
are not very numerous. While some women have seven, eight,
nine, or even ten children, they are exceptional cases. And when a
woman gives birth to so many, they do not always reach maturity.
There are women who have never borne any children, and some men
have never begotten any. One woman, who is of Blackfoot origin, is
the wife of James Springer, an Omaha, and she has borne him twelve
children; but no other woman has had as many.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<h3 id="CHILDREN">CHILDREN.</h3>

<p id="s92">§ 92. <i>Diseases of children.</i>&mdash;Summer complaint from teething is rare.
Diarrhea, however, occurs frequently, even in children who walk, and
when they are about four feet high. This may be accounted for as follows:
their mothers' milk or other food disagrees with them. Dougherty
found that during their first year the Omaha children suffered more
from constipation than from any other complaint; and he said that this
was relieved by soap suppositories. This is not the case now, according
to La Flèche and Two Crows; and the writer never heard of its
prevalence when he resided among the Ponkas and Omahas.</p>

<p id="s93">§ 93. <i>Adoption of children.</i>&mdash;The Omaha idea of adoption differs from
ours. A member of the same gens, or one who is a consanguinity cannot
be adopted; he or she is received by a relation. Two examples of this
were told to the writer: Gahige received Wacuce's eldest son when the
father died, because the former had been the potential father of the
youth, who succeeded Wacuce as custodian of the sacred pipes. Now
Gahige keeps the pipes himself for his son. A<sup>n</sup>pa<sup>n</sup>-sk&#259;, of the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte
gens, gave his son, Bi<sup>n</sup>ze-tig¢e, to his chief, Mahi<sup>n</sup>-¢iñge, to be his son and
servant. Mahi<sup>n</sup>-¢iñge having received his kinsman, the latter has become
the keeper of the treaty between the United States and the Omahas.
This boy is about sixteen years of age.</p>

<p>Omaha adoption is called "ciégi¢ě," <i>to take a person instead of one's
own child</i>. This is done when the adopted person resembles the deceased
child, grandchild, nephew, or niece, in one or more features. It
takes place without any ceremony. An uncle by adoption has all the
rights of a real uncle. For example, when Mr. La Flèche's daughter
Susette wished to go to the Indian Territory to accept a situation as
teacher, and had gained the consent of her parents, Two Crows interposed,
being her uncle by adoption, and forbade her departure. (See
§§ <a href="#s118">118</a> and <a href="#s126">126</a>.)</p>

<p id="s94">§ 94. <i>Clothing of children.</i>&mdash;Children were dressed in suits like those
of their parents, but they used to wear robes made of the skins of the
deer, antelope, or of buffalo calves. When the boys were very small,
say, till they were about four years old, they used to run about in warm
weather with nothing on but a small belt of cloth around the waist, according
to Dougherty; and the writer has seen such boys going about
entirely naked. Girls always wear clothing, even, when small. When
a boy was eight years old, he began to wear in winter leggings, moccasins,
and a small robe.</p>

<p id="s95">§ 95. <i>Child life.</i>&mdash;The girl was kept in a state of subjection to her
mother, whom she was obliged to help when the latter was at work.
When she was four or five years old, she was taught to go for wood,
etc. When she was about eight years of age, she learned how to make
up a pack, and began to carry a small pack on her back. If she was
disobedient, she received a blow on the head or back from the hand of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
her mother. As she grew older, she learned how to cut wood, to cultivate
corn, and other branches of an Indian woman's work. When a
girl was about three feet high, she used to wear her hair tied up in
four rolls, one on top of her head, one at the back, and one at each side.
This lasted till she was about six years old. The girl manifested the
most affectionate regard for her parents and other near kindred.</p>

<p>With a boy there was not so much strictness observed. He had more
liberty allowed him; and at an early age he was furnished with a bow
and blunt arrows, with which he practiced shooting at marks, then at
birds. He had his sports as well as the girl, though it was not usual
for many boys and girls to play together. If a boy played with girls
(probably with those who were not his sisters), the Ponkas referred to
him as a "mi<sup>n</sup>quga" or hermaphrodite. Both sexes were fond of making
houses in the mud, hence the verb, ʇígaxe, <i>to make lodges</i>, <i>to play
games</i>.</p>

<p>Joseph La Flèche used to punish his son, Frank, by tying him to a
chair with a cord and saying to him, "If you break the cord I will strike
you."</p>

<p>When a boy was seven or eight years old he was expected to undergo
a fast for a single day. He had to ascend a bluff and remain
there, crying to Wakanda to pity him and make him a great man.
Dougherty said that the boy rubbed white clay over himself, and went
to the bluff at sunrise. When the boy was about sixteen years of age
he had to fast for two days in succession. This had to be without any
fire, as well as without food and drink; hence, it was not practiced in
the winter nor in the month of March. The period of fasting was prolonged
to four days when the boy was from eighteen to twenty years
of age. Some youths fasted in October; some fasted in the spring,
after the breaking up of the ice on the Missouri River. The same youth
might fast more than once in the course of the year. Some who fasted
thought that Wakanda spoke to them.</p>

<p>Boys took part with their elders in the Hede-watci, when they danced,
stripped of all clothing except the breech-cloth.</p>

<h3 id="STANDING_OF_WOMEN_IN_SOCIETY">STANDING OF WOMEN IN SOCIETY.</h3>

<p id="s96">§ 96. The women had an equal standing in society, though their duties
differed widely from what we imagine they should be. On cold
days, when the husband knew that it was difficult for the woman to
pursue her usual occupations, he was accustomed to go with her to
cut wood, and he used to assist her in carrying it home. But on
warm days the woman used to go alone for the wood. The women
used to dress the hides at home, or at the tent in which she was
staying when the people were traveling. When a woman was strong
she hoed the ground and planted the corn; but if she was delicate or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
weak, her husband was willing to help her by hoeing with her. The
woman did the work which she thought was hers to do. She always
did her work of her own accord. The husband had his share of the
labor, for the man was not accustomed to lead an idle life. Before
the introduction of fire-arms the man had to depend on his bow and
arrows for killing the buffaloes, deer, etc., and hunting was no easy task.
The Indian never hunted game for sport.</p>

<h3 id="CATAMENIA">CATAMENIA.</h3>

<p id="s97">§ 97. The sexual peculiarity was considered as "Wakan´daʇa´¢ica<sup>n</sup>,"
<i>pertaining to Wakanda</i>. In the myth of the Rabbit and the Black
Bears, Mactciñge, the Rabbit, threw a piece of the Black Bear chief
against his grandmother, who had offended him, thereby causing her
to have the catamenia. From that time women have been so affected.
Among the Omahas and Ponkas the woman makes a different fire for
four days, dwelling in a small lodge, apart from the rest of the household,
even in cold weather. She cooks and eats alone, telling no one
of her sickness, not even her husband. Grown people do not fear
her, but children are caused to fear the odor which she is said to
give forth. If any eat with her they become sick in the chest, very
lean, and their lips become parched in a circle about two inches in diameter.
Their blood grows black. Children vomit. On the fourth or
fifth day, she bathes herself, and washes her dishes, etc. Then she can
return to the household. Another woman who is similarly affected can
stay with her in the small lodge, if she knows the circumstances. During
this period, the men will neither lie nor eat with the woman; and
they will not use the same dish, bowl, and spoon. For more than ten
years, and since they have come in closer contact with the white people,
this custom of refusing to eat from the same dish, etc., has become obsolete.
Dougherty stated that in the young Omaha female, catamenia
and consequent capability for child-bearing, took place about the twelfth
or thirteenth year, and the capacity to bear children seemed to cease
about the fortieth year. This agrees in the main with what the writer
has learned about the age of puberty (§ <a href="#s80">80</a>) and the law of widows (§ <a href="#s98">98</a>).
La Flèche said that the change of life in a woman occurs perhaps at
forty years of age, and sometimes a little beyond that age.</p>

<h3 id="WIDOWS_AND_WIDOWERS">WIDOWS AND WIDOWERS.</h3>

<p id="s98">§ 98. <i>Widows.</i>&mdash;A widow was obliged to wait from four to seven
years after the death of her husband before marrying again. This was
done to show the proper respect to his memory, and also to enable her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
to wean her infant, if she had one by him, before she became <i>enceinte</i>
by her next husband. When a woman disregarded this custom and
married too soon, she was in danger of being punished by the kindred
of the deceased husband. If they could catch her within a certain period,
they had the right to strike her on the head with knives, and
to draw the blood, but they could not inflict a fatal blow. Now, if
widows are under forty years of age they can marry in two or three
years after the death of the first husband; but if they are over forty
years of age, they do not remarry.</p>

<p id="s99">§ 99. <i>Stepmothers.</i>&mdash;Some are kind, others are cruel. But in the latter
event there are certain remedies&mdash;the husband may separate from
his wife, or else some of the kindred of the children may take charge
of them.</p>

<p id="s100">§ 100. <i>Widowers.</i>&mdash;Men used to wait from four to seven years before
they remarried; now they do not wait over one or two years. The kindred
of the deceased wife used to take a man's ponies from him if he
married too soon. Sometimes they became angry, and hit him; but if
he waited a reasonable time, they had nothing to say. There is a similar
custom among the Otos and Pawnees. Sometimes a man loved his
wife so dearly that after her death he remained a widower a long time.
At last some of the kindred of the deceased woman would say to one
another, "See! this man has no one to sew his moccasins; seek a wife
for him (among our women)." Then this would be done, and he would
be induced to marry again.</p>

<h3 id="RIGHTS_OF_PARENTS_AND_OTHERS">RIGHTS OF PARENTS AND OTHERS.</h3>

<p id="s101">§ 101. <i>Rights of parents and other kindred.</i>&mdash;Parents had no right to
put their children to death; nor could they force them to marry against
their will. Mothers' brothers and brothers seem to have more authority
than the father or mother in matters relating to a girl's welfare.
They were consulted before she was bestowed in marriage, unless
she eloped with her husband. A mother could punish a disobedient
daughter when the latter was a child and refused to learn to work.
Kindred had the right to avenge the death of one of their number.</p>

<p id="s102">§ 102. <i>Ú¢iqě, or Refugees.</i>&mdash;They have no special rights, as such; but
they share the privileges of the people with whom they dwell, and with
whom they sometimes intermarry. Omahas have joined the Ponka
tribe, as in the case of Ma<sup>n</sup>tcu-sĭnde-¢iñge, and Ponkas have been incorporated
into the Omaha tribe, as in the cases of Jabe-sk&#259;, [P]enicka,
and Mr. La Flèche himself.</p>

<p id="s103">§ 103. <i>Isínu.</i>&mdash;An isínu is an unmarried youth, or man who dwells in
the lodge of one of his friends or kindred. He may be the kinsman of
the husband or of the wife. He is also called a wama<sup>n</sup>he.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

<p><i>Wama<sup>n</sup>´he and Áma<sup>n</sup>he.</i>&mdash;The owner of a lodge, whether a man or a
woman, is the ama<sup>n</sup>he, and the isínu is the wama<sup>n</sup>he, who has no lodge
of his own, and is obliged to ask for shelter of some one who is more
favored than himself. While the wama<sup>n</sup>he has shelter he is expected
to do his share of the hunting of game, etc., just as all the other male
members of the household do, and he must bring it in for the benefit
of his host and the household. Sometimes the ama<sup>n</sup>he gives a skin
tent to the wama<sup>n</sup>he, who then goes elsewhere, as he has a lodge of
his own.</p>

<p>Only those men are celibates who cannot get wives. There are no
single women, as the demand is greater than the supply.</p>

<h3 id="PERSONAL_HABITS_POLITENESS_ETC">PERSONAL HABITS, POLITENESS, ETC.</h3>

<p id="s104">§ 104. <i>Personal habits.</i>&mdash;The Omahas generally bathe (hi¢á) every day
in warm weather, early in the morning and at night. Some who wish
to do so bathe also at noon. "Jackson," a member of the Elk gens, bathes
every day, even in winter. He breaks a hole in the ice on the Missouri
River and bathes, or else he rubs snow over his body. In winter the
Omahas heat water in a kettle and wash themselves (ʞig¢íja). This occurs
in some cases every week, but when a person is prevented by much
work it is practiced once in two or three weeks. There are some who
are not so particular about washing. One chief, Wacka<sup>n</sup>ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>, was
nicknamed "The man who does not wash his hands," and his wife was
styled "The woman who does not comb her hair." Wacka<sup>n</sup>ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup> heard
of this, and it shamed him into better habits. It was always the custom
to brush and comb their hair, and the writer has a specimen, "qade-mi-ʞahe,"
such as served the Omahas of a former generation for both brush
and comb. The Ponkas used to bathe in the Missouri every day. The
Pawnees used to neglect this custom, but of late years they have observed
it. La Flèche and Two Crows prefer the sweat-bath to all other
ways of cleansing the body. They say that it is not a sacred rite,
though some Indians pretend that it is such; and it is so described in
the myths. Cedar twigs are still dropped on the hot stones to cause a
perfume.</p>

<p id="s105">§ 105. <i>Politeness.</i>&mdash;When friends or kindred have not met for about a
month they say, on meeting, "Hau! kagéha," <i>Ho! younger brother</i>,
"Hau! negíha," <i>Ho! mother's brother</i>, etc., calling each other by their
respective kinship titles, if there be any, and then they shake hands.
There are no other verbal salutations. Parents kiss their children,
especially when they have been separated for any time, or when they are
about to part. When the chief, Standing Grizzly Bear, met Peter Primeau,
Ma<sup>n</sup>tcu-hi-<sup>n</sup>qti, and Cahie¢a at Niobrara in January, 1881, he embraced
them, and seemed to be very deeply affected. La Flèche and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
Two Crows did not know about this custom, which may have been borrowed
by the Ponkas from the Dakotas.</p>

<p>When persons attend feasts they extend their hands and return
thanks to the giver. So also when they receive presents. When favors
are asked, as when the chiefs and brave men interpose to prevent the slaying
of a murderer, each extends a hand with the palm towards the would be
avengers, or he may extend both hands, calling the people by kinship
titles, with the hope of appeasing them. If a man receives a
favor and does not manifest his gratitude, they exclaim, "Wajé-¢iñge
áha<sup>n</sup>!"&mdash;<i>He does not appreciate the gift! He has no manners!</i> They
apply the same expression to the master of a tent who does not show
any desire to be hospitable to a visitor.</p>

<p>A person is never addressed by name, except when there are two or
more present who are of the same kinship degree. Then they must be
distinguished by their names. They seldom call a person by name when
speaking about him. This rule is not observed when guests are invited
to feasts. The criers call them by name. When men return from war
the old men, who act as criers, halloo and recount the deeds of each warrior,
whom they mention by name. After a battle between the Ponkas
and Dakotas, in 1873, as the former were returning to the village after
the repulse of the latter, Na<sup>n</sup>be-¢iʞu, of the Wajaje gens, stopped at
the house of Ma<sup>n</sup>tcu-ʇañga, who had distinguished himself in the fight.
Na<sup>n</sup>be-¢iʞu gave a yell, and after leaping a short distance from the
ground, he struck the door of the house with the blunt end of the spear,
exclaiming "Ma<sup>n</sup>tcu-ʇañga, you are a Wajaje!" In making presents,
as after returning from war, the donor can mention the name of the
donee.</p>

<p>People never mention the names of their parents or elders, of their
iʇiga<sup>n</sup>, iʞa<sup>n</sup>, etc. A woman cannot mention her iʇinu's name; but if her
isañga (younger brother) be small, she can call his name.</p>

<p>Mothers teach their children not pass in front of people, if they can
avoid it. Young girls cannot speak to any man except he be a brother,
father, mother's brother, or a grandfather, who is a consanguinity.
Otherwise they would give rise to scandal. Girls can be more familiar
with their mother's brother than with their own brothers. Even boys
are more familiar with their mother's brother than with their own father,
and they often play tricks on the former.</p>

<p>Politeness is shown by men to women. Men used to help women and
children to alight from horses. When they had to ford streams, the
men used to assist them, and sometimes they carried them across on
their backs. Even if a man is not the woman's husband, he may offer
to carry her over instead of letting her wade. One day, a young woman
who was on her way to Decatur, Nebr., with her brother, wished to stop
at a spring, as she was thirsty. The ground by the spring was muddy,
and the woman would have soiled her clothing had she knelt. But just
then Maxewa¢e rode up and jumped from his horse. He pulled up some

grass and placed it on the ground, so that the woman might drink without
soiling her dress. Such occurrences have been common.</p>

<p id="s106">§ 106. <i>Hospitality.</i>&mdash;All who are present at meal-time receive shares
of the food. Even if some who are not on friendly terms with the host
happen to enter suddenly they partake. But only friends are invited
to feasts. Should one arrive after all the food has been divided among
the guests, the host gives part of his share to the new-comer, saying,
"Take that." The new-comer never says, "Give it to me." Should a
woman come the host gives her some of the uncooked food, and tells
her to take it home and boil it. Sometimes the host sees several uninvited
ones looking on. Then he tells his wife to boil some food for them.
Or, if the wife was the first to notice their presence, she asks her husband's
permission. He replies, "Yes, do it."</p>

<p>Here and there in the tribe are those who are stingy, and who do not
show hospitality. Should an enemy appear in the lodge, and receive a
mouthful of food or water, or put the pipe in his mouth, he cannot be
injured by any member of the tribe, as he is bound for the time being
by the ties of hospitality, and they are compelled to protect him, and
send him to his home in safety. But they may kill him the next time
that they meet him.</p>

<p>When a visitor enters a lodge to which he has not been invited (as to
a feast), he passes to the right of the fire-place, and takes a seat at the
back of the lodge opposite the door.</p>

<p>The master of the lodge may sit where he pleases; and the women have
seats by the entrance. Sometimes there is an aged male kinsman staying
at the lodge, and his place is on the right side of the fire-place near the
entrance. (Frank La Flèche. Compare § <a href="#s112">112</a>, as given by his father.)</p>

<p id="s107">§ 107. <i>Meals.</i>&mdash;When the people were traveling in search of buffaloes,
they generally had but two meals a day, one in the morning before they
struck the tents, and one in the evening after they pitched the tents.
But if they moved the camp early in the morning, as in the summer,
they had three meals&mdash;breakfast, before the camp was moved; dinner,
when they camped again; and supper, when they camped for the night.
During the winter, they stopped their march early in the afternoon, and
ate but one meal during the day. When the camp remained stationary,
they sometimes had three meals a day, if the days were long. They ate
ʇa (dried buffalo meat), ʇanuʞa (fresh meat), and wata<sup>n</sup>zi (corn), which
satisfied their hunger. And they could go a long time without a meal.
Soup was the only drink during meals. They drank water after meals,
when they were thirsty. They washed the dishes in water, and rubbed
them dry with twisted grass. The trader's story in <i>Long's Expedition to</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
<i>the Rocky Mountains</i>, Vol. I, pp. 322, 323, if true, relates to some other
tribe.</p>

<p>The average amount of meat at a meal for an adult was two pounds,
but some ate three pounds. The maximum quantity was about four
pounds.</p>

<p id="s108">§ 108. During the sun-dance, the Ponkas pretended to go without food
or drink for three days and nights; but near the sun-pole could be found
a bulbous root, which was used by the dancers for satisfying hunger
and thirst. This secret was told the writer by a man, an influential
chief, who had taken part in the dance in former years. This dance is
of Dakota origin, and is not practiced among the Omahas.</p>

<p id="s109">§ 109. At the present day, the Omahas use wheat, flour, sugar, coffee,
tea, bacon, and other kinds of provisions introduced by the white people.
They have been familiar with wheat for the past forty years. Many
subsist chiefly on corn, as they cannot afford to buy great quantities of
the provisions which have been mentioned. But while they are fond of
wheat bread, they cannot be induced to eat corn bread in any shape, and
they never have their corn ground into meal. All try to have sugar and
coffee three times a day, even if they are compelled to go without meat.
Within the past twenty years they have found a substitute for tea. It
is made of the leaves or roots of one of the two species of "ʇabé-hi."
One kind is called "na<sup>n</sup>´pa-ʇañ´ga ʇabé-hi," or "large cherry ʇabé-hi";
but the species of which the tea is made is the ʇabé-hi, which spreads out,
resembling twigs. It grows on hills, and its large roots hinder the breaking
of the prairie. The leaves, which are preferred for making the tea,
resemble those of red cherry-trees, though they are smaller. When leaves
cannot be obtained, they boil chips of the roots, which makes the water
very red. The taste resembles that of the Chinese tea. (See § <a href="#s177">177</a>.)</p>

<p id="s110">§ 110. <i>Cannibalism.</i>&mdash;Cannibalism is not practiced among the Omahas
and Ponkas, and it has been of rare occurrence among the Iowas. Mr.
Hamilton says: "I have heard of an old Iowa chief who roasted and ate
the ribs of an Osage killed in war; also of some one who bit the heart
of a Pawnee, but this was evidently done for the purpose of winning a
reputation for bravery."</p>

<p id="s111">§ 111. <i>Feasts.</i>&mdash;See §§ <a href="#s81">81</a>, <a href="#s83">83</a>, <a href="#s106">106</a>, <a href="#s119">119</a>, <a href="#s124">124</a>, <a href="#s130">130</a>, <a href="#s143">143</a>, <a href="#s151">151</a>, <a href="#s187">187</a>-<a href="#s188">8</a>, <a href="#s195">195</a>-<a href="#s196">6</a>,

<p>During the buffalo hunt and just before starting on it the only gens
that invited guests to feasts was the Hañga. And whenever any important
matters, such as the ceremonies connected with planting corn,
required deliberation, it was the duty of the Hañga chief to prepare a
feast and invite the chiefs and other guests. (See §§ <a href="#s18">18</a>, <a href="#s130">130</a>.) On ordinary
occasions, any one can have a feast. (See § <a href="#s246">246</a>.) Then the
principal guest sits at the back of the lodge, opposite the door, on the
right of which are the seats of the wag¢a, the host's seat being on the
left of the entrance. As the guests enter they pass to the left and
around the circle, those coming first taking seats next the wag¢a, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
the last ones arriving finding places near the host. Two young men who
take out the meat, etc., from the kettles, have no fixed places for sitting.</p>

<p>They give feasts to get horses and other presents, to win a reputation
for generosity, and perhaps an election to the chieftainship; also
for social and other purposes.</p>

<p><i>The Mandan feast.</i>&mdash;The following is an account of a feast given by
the Mandan dancing society: "When the food has been prepared the
crier or herald calls for those to come to the feast who take part in the
dance. To bad men he says, 'Do not come to the feast at which I am
going to eat,' and they stay away. Should the guests be slow in coming,
the last one who arrives is punished. He is compelled to eat a
large quantity of food, 6, 8, or 10 pounds. The others sit waiting for
him to eat all that has been placed before him, and as they wait they
shake the rattles of deer-claws and beat the drum. This is not a
sacred rite, but an amusement. If the man finds that he cannot eat all
in his bowl, he looks around the circle and finds some one to whom he
gives a blanket, shirt, gun, or a pair of leggings, with the rest of the
food saying, 'Friend, help me (by eating this).' Should the second
man fail to eat all, he in turn must make a present to a third man, and
induce him to finish the contents of the bowl. Sometimes horses are
given as presents. Should a man come without an invitation, just to
look on, and enter the lodge of his own accord, he must give presents
to several of the guests, and depart without joining in the feast. When
one smokes, he extends the pipe to another saying, 'Smoke.' The second
man smokes without taking hold of the pipe. Should he forget
and take hold of it, all the rest give the scalp-yell, and then he is
obliged to make a present to some one present who is not one of his
kindred. Should one of the men make a mistake in singing, or should
he not know how to sing correctly, as he joins the rest, they give the
scalp-yell, and he is compelled to make a present to some one who is not
one of his kindred. If one of the guests lets fall anything by accident,
he forfeits it and cannot take it up. Any one else can appropriate it.
While at this feast no one gets angry; all must keep in a good humor.
None but old men or those in the prime of life belong to this society."</p>

<p>Sometimes the guests danced while they were eating. All wore deers'
tail head-dresses, and carried rattles of deers' claws on their arms. One
drum was used. There was no fixed number of singers; generally there
were six. Each one danced as he stood in his place, instead of moving
around the lodge. There was no special ornamentation of the face and
body with paint. All wore good clothing. The Omahas danced this
Mandan dance after the death of Logan Fontenelle.</p>

<p>Those who boil sacred food, as for the war-path, pour some of the
soup outside the lodge, as an offering for the ghosts.</p>

<p id="s112">§ 112. <i>Sleeping customs.</i>&mdash;They sleep when sleepy, chiefly at night.
There are no sacred rites connected with sleeping. Adults occupy that
part of the lodge next to the door, having their beds on each side of it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
(See § <a href="#s106">106</a>.) Children have their beds at the back of the lodge, opposite
the entrance. When there are many children and few adults, the former
occupy most of the circle.</p>

<p>Each member of the household pushes the sticks of wood together
("abada<sup>n</sup>") towards the center of the fire, as the ends burn off. It is
not the special work of the old women or men. Nor are the aged women
expected to sit at the door and drive out the dogs. Any one may drive
them from the lodge, except in cold weather, when they are allowed to
remain inside.</p>

<p id="s113">§ 113. <i>Charities.</i>&mdash;The word for generous is "wacúce," meaning also
"to be brave." This is apparently the primary meaning, as a generous
man is addressed as one who does not fear poverty. He is regarded
as the equal of the man who fears no enemy. Generosity cannot
be exercised toward kindred, who have a natural right to our assistance.
All who wish to become great men are advised by their kindred
to be kind to the poor and aged, and to invite guests to feasts.
When one sees a poor man or woman, he should make presents, such
as goods or a horse, to the unfortunate being. Thus can he gain the
good-will of Wakanda, as well as that of his own people. When the
Omahas had plenty of corn, and the Ponkas or Pawnees had very little,
the former used to share their abundance with the latter. And so when
the Omahas were unfortunate with their crops, they went on several
occasions to the Pawnees, who gave them a supply. This was customary
among these and other neighboring tribes.</p>

<p>Presents must also be made to visitors, members of other tribes. To
neglect this was regarded as a gross breach of good manners. (See § <a href="#s292">292</a>.)</p>

<p>Prior to the advent of the white man, the Omahas had a custom,
which was told the writer by Frank La Flèche. When one man wished
to favor another by enabling him to be generous, he gave him horses,
which the latter, in turn, gave away, entitling him to have his ears
pierced as a token of his generosity. The act of the first man was
known as "niʇa gíbaq¢ukí¢ě," <i>causing another man to have his ears
pierced</i>.</p>

<p id="s114">§ 114. <i>Old age.</i>&mdash;Old age among the Omahas does not encounter all
the difficulties related by Dougherty (<i>Long</i>, I, pp. 256, 257). Old men
do not work. They sometimes go after the horses, or take them to
water, but the rest of the time they sit and smoke, or relate incidents
of their youthful days, and occasionally they tell myths for the amusement
of those around them. Old women throw away superfluous ashes,
pound corn or dried meat, mend and dry moccasins, etc. Sometimes
they used to bring a bundle of sticks for the fire, but that is now done
by the men in their wagons.</p>

<p>The Omahas and Ponkas never abandoned the infirm aged people on
the prairie. They left them at home, where they could remain till the
return of the hunting party. They were provided with a shelter among
the trees, food, water, and fire. They watched the corn-fields, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
when their provisions gave out, they could gather the ears of corn, and
procure some of the dried pumpkins and ʇa (dried meat) that had been
buried in <i>caches</i> by the people. They were not left for a long time,
generally for but a month or two. The Indians were afraid to abandon
(waa<sup>n</sup>´¢a) their aged people, lest Wakanda should punish them when they
were away from home. They always placed them (i¢a<sup>n</sup>´wa¢ě) near their
village, where they made their home during the winter.</p>

<p>They do not grow gray early, though Mr. Hamilton saw some children
that were gray. But gray hairs are of such rare occurrence that
an Omaha woman who has them is called "Gray Hair." When any one
has white hair it is regarded as a token that he or she has violated the
taboo of the gens, as when an Ictasanda or Wajaje man should touch a
snake or smell its odor.</p>

<p id="s115">§ 115. <i>Preparation for a journey.</i>&mdash;When a man is about to start on
a journey he gets his wife to prepare moccasins and food for him. Then
he goes alone to a bluff, and prays to Wakanda to grant him a joyful and
stout heart as well as success. (See § <a href="#s195">195</a>.)

<small>VISITING CUSTOMS.</small></h2>

<p id="s116">§ 116. <i>Medicines or fetiches taken along.</i>&mdash;Some of the ₵egiha used to
take their respective medicines with them, saying, "Our medicines are
wise; they can talk like men, and they tell us how many horses we are
to receive from the people to whom we are going." For an account of
the dance of discovering the enemy, as Dougherty terms it, see § <a href="#s271">271</a>.
It is danced by visitors.</p>

<p id="s117">§ 117. <i>Mode of approaching a village.</i>&mdash;When people go to make a
friendly visit to another tribe, they stop when they are a short distance
from the village or camp of their hosts, say at about 100 or 200 yards
from it. There they sit on the ground and wait for some one to come
and invite them to the village. Generally, each visitor departs with
his special friend, or with the messenger sent from the village by that
friend. On some occasions, all the visitors have been invited to one
lodge, but these have been very unusual. The Omahas, Ponkas, Dakotas,
Pawnees, and other tribes act thus when they visit.</p>

<h3 id="THE_CALUMET_DANCE">THE CALUMET DANCE.</h3>

<p id="s118">§ 118. <i>The Calumet Dance.</i>&mdash;The generic term is "wáwa<sup>n</sup>," in ₵egiha,
answering to the [T]ᴐiwere "waya<sup>n</sup>´we" (the specific of which is "ákiwa<sup>n</sup>,"
[T]ᴐiwere, akíya<sup>n</sup>we), to dance the calumet dance for any particular person.
But the word makes no reference to dancing or singing. It is
equivalent to "waqúbe éki¢ě," <i>to make a sacred kinship</i>. He who wishes
to confer this degree is called "wáwa<sup>n</sup> aká," the dancer of the calumet
dance, which is also the title of those who assist him. He for whom the
dance is made is the "áwa<sup>n</sup>i aká," who becomes the adopted son of the
other man.</p>

<p id="s119">§ 119. <i>The preliminary feast.</i>&mdash;When a man contemplates adopting
another man in this dance he invites all the other chiefs to a feast, and
consults them. When the person has not been selected he says to them,
"Wáwama<sup>n</sup> ka<sup>n</sup>´b¢a. I<sup>n</sup>wi<sup>n</sup>´¢ixi´dai-g&#259;"&mdash;<i>I wish to dance the calumet
dance for some one; look ye around for me</i> (and see who would be the
proper object). But if he has already selected the person, he says to
the chiefs, "Áwama<sup>n</sup> ka<sup>n</sup>´b¢a. I<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>´wa<sup>n</sup>da<sup>n</sup>´bai-g&#259;"&mdash;<i>I wish to dance
for him. See for me if he is the proper one.</i> Sometimes they reply,
"Let him alone! He is not the right one, as he is bad;" or, "Ni´aci<sup>n</sup>ga
¢i<sup>n</sup> píäjĭ h&#259;. Ji<sup>n</sup>´äjĭ. Ákiwa<sup>n</sup>´jĭ-g&#259;"&mdash;<i>The man is bad. He is proud.
Do not dance for him.</i> But should the chiefs give their approval, the
man sends a messenger to the one whom he intends to honor, having
intrusted to him a buffalo bladder containing tobacco, which is sent as
a present. When the messenger reaches the place, and delivers his
message, the awa<sup>n</sup>i aka calls his kindred together to lay the proposition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
before them. Sometimes he says, "I am poor. Do not come." In
that case the messenger returns home, and the dance does not take
place. But if the awa<sup>n</sup>i aka approve, and his kindred give their consent,
he sends the messenger back with a favorable reply. In some
instances, when one man has asked another to dance the calumet dance
for him, the other one has replied, "Why should I dance it for you?
Why should I give such a privilege to a bad man?"</p>

<p id="s120">§ 120. At the appointed time, the dancing party, which consists of two
leaders and many companions, repairs to the
place of destination. Sometimes the leaders
take from twenty to thirty men with them.
They reach the lodge of the awa<sup>n</sup>i aka, and
there the two niniba weawa<sup>n</sup>, or calumet
pipes, are placed on a forked support, which
is driven into the soil in the back part of the
lodge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span>&mdash;The Weawa<sup>n</sup>, or Calumet
pipe.</p>
</div>

<p id="s121">§ 121. <i>Description of the pipes, etc.</i>&mdash;The following
is a description of the calumet pipes:</p>

<p>In the place of a pipe-bowl each weawa<sup>n</sup>
has the head and neck of a "mi<sup>n</sup>´xa [p]áhi<sup>n</sup>-ʇú,"
or green-necked duck. Next to this, on the
upper side of the stem, are (yellowish) feathers
of the great owl, extending about six inches.
Next are long wing-feathers of the war eagle,
split and stuck on longitudinally in three
places, as on an arrow shaft. At the end
of these is some horsehair, which has been
reddened. It is wrapped around the stem,
tied on with sinew, and then over that is
fastened some of the fur of the white rabbit,
with some ends dangling about six inches.
The horsehair extends fully six inches below
the fur of the rabbit. This horsehair is
attached in two other places, and tied in a
similar manner. The three tufts are equidistant,
say, six inches apart. Near the last
tuft is the head of a wajiñ´ga-[p]a, woodcock (?),
the nose of which is white, and the head
feathers are red. The bill is turned towards
the mouth-piece.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>The head of the duck is secured to the stem
by the "ha-jíde," which used to be made of
deer or antelope skin, but since the coming of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
the white men a piece of red blanket or Indian cloth has been substituted.
Next to this are suspended the two "wéʇa" or eggs, which are two
hi<sup>n</sup>qpé, or plumes of the eagle. But the Indians compare them to the
egg or to the eaglet in the egg, to which the adopted child is also likened.
The child is still immature; but by and by he will grow, and fly like
the eagle. Next are attached a number of eagle feathers. These are
secured by two cords, called the "máca<sup>n</sup> i¢áze ¢a<sup>n</sup>," made of deer or antelope
skin.</p>

<p>On one pipe the eagle feathers are white, being those of a male eagle,
and the pipe-stem is dark blue. On the other, they are spotted black
and white, being those of a female eagle; and the pipe-stem is dark blue.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span>&mdash;Rattles used in the Pipe dance.</p>
</div>

<p id="s122">§ 122. There are two gourd
rattles, one for each pipe. Each
gourd is about five inches in
diameter. A handle is thrust
through the gourd, one end of
which projects about an inch
beyond the top of the gourd.
Blue stripes about half an inch
wide encircle each gourd; and two blue stripes crossing each other at
right angles extend half way around, terminating when they meet the
other stripe, which divides the gourd in two parts. Around the handle
is tied deer skin, antelope skin, or a piece of buffalo skin. The ʇe-néxe,
or buffalo bladder, which is sent at first by the messenger, is painted
with three blue stripes, as on the gourd rattles. It is tied with a small,
fine piece of the skin of a deer or antelope, arranged so as to be opened
very easily and with the ends dangling a little.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

</div>

<p id="s123">§ 123. When the pipes are rested against the
forked stick, the heads of the ducks are placed
next the ground. A short distance from the pipes
are two sticks connected with an ear of corn, which
is sacred. It must be a perfect ear; the grains
must not be rough or shriveled. If grains are
wanting on one row or side, the ear is rejected.
All the people eat the corn, so it is regarded as a
<i>mother</i>. (See § <a href="#s163">163</a>.)</p>

<p>These sticks are reddened with wase-jide-nika, or Indian red. The
longer stick, which is nearer the pipes, is stuck about four inches into
the ground, and projects a few inches above the ear of corn. The
other stick is fastened to the opposite side of the ear of corn; the top
of it is on a line with the top of the ear, and the bottom extends a
short distance below the bottom of the ear, but it does not reach to
the ground. The ear of corn is held between the sticks by "ʇahá¢isa<sup>n</sup>´,"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
which is wrapped around them all. This fastening is made of
the plaited or braided hair taken from the head of a buffalo. An eagle
plume (hi<sup>n</sup>qpe) is fastened with sinew to the top of the smaller stick.
The lower part of the ear of corn is white, and the upper part is painted
green.</p>

<p id="s124">§ 124. <i>Feasting and singing.</i>&mdash;The next morning before sunrise some
of the visitors sing as a signal for the people to arise and assemble.
Before they sing the áwa<sup>n</sup>i amá say to them, "Come, O fathers, sing
ye." They do not sing over an hour, perhaps not quite so long. When
the men begin to sing the pipes are taken from their support, and are
not returned till the singing is concluded. The singing is inside the
lodge, as they sit around the fire. They sing again after breakfast, a
third time in the afternoon, and once more at night. This generally
continues for two days, during which time the visitors are feasted.
Sometimes they continue the feasts for three days.</p>

<p><i>Gifts bestowed.</i>&mdash;The day after the feasts, which is generally the third
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
day, the principal visitor gives presents to his host, who collects all
of the people of his village or tribe. He addresses the chiefs, saying,
"My father has brought these things to me." Then he gives the presents
to the chiefs. The pile of gifts is often about four feet high. One
or more of the chiefs then speak to the young men who accompany them,
"These things are given to you. Do with them as you please. Give
them to whom you desire to present them." Presently one young man
arises and says, "I will give a horse to my father," meaning the principal
visitor. He is followed by another, and so on, till all have spoken
who have a desire to make presents. Some of the young men give many
horses to the visitors. When the principal chief sees that enough horses
have been given in equal numbers to each visitor he says, "Come, cease
ye." Then the chiefs imitate the young men in giving presents to the
visitors, taking care to give none of them a larger share than the rest.
This exchange of presents consumes the entire day. The principal visitor
has the right to distribute the horses among his party.</p>

"cka<sup>n</sup>´ ¢ipí," <i>i. e.</i>, skillful in imitating the movements and acts of the
war eagle, its flying, etc. When it is windy a screen is set up, but when
it is calm there is none. Before the dance is begun the man for whom
the ceremony is made leads his son or daughter to his visitors, saying,
"&cent;é á¢awa<sup>n</sup>´ te h&#259;´," <i>Please dance for this one.</i> But the parent does
not bring the child by himself; one of the dancers always goes for the
child, and must carry it on his back to the lodge where the dancers are
staying. When one of the men came to the house of Mr. La Flèche for
his daughter Susette, she was very small and so was afraid of the man,
and refused to go with him. So her mother's mother carried her part
of the way, and then the man took her to the lodge. After the father
has addressed the visitors the child is caused to sit with the members
of the dancing party. Its face is painted red, and over that is painted
in blue, the hañga ʞi`a<sup>n</sup>ze, and a stripe down the nose.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> An eagle plume
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
or hi<sup>n</sup>qpe is placed in its hair. The child receives clothing from the
principal visitor, if he has it; but if has none, another member of the
party gives the clothing. Then the adopting father says to the child,
"We give you a sacred thing. Do not have a bad heart. We make you
sacred, we set you apart. We have received this custom from Wakanda.
We give you a sign, and henceforth no one can say that you
are poor."</p>

<p>The child so adopted is called "Hañ´ga ¢iñké" during the dance.
Compare the "hŭñ´ka (huŋka)" of the Dakotas.</p>

<p>There is no regular order of sitting. The drummer and singers sit
in the middle, and the child is with them. Near them are the two
dancers, who wear no clothing but breech-cloths. Both have the hañga
ʞi`a<sup>n</sup>ze painted in red on their faces. Each one holds a gourd rattle in
his right hand. It contains hard seed, beads, or fine gravel. In their
left hands are the calumet pipes. They dance for about an hour, imitating
the actions of the war eagle, preserving at the same time a constant
waving motion with the calumet, and agitating the gourds more
or less vehemently, agreeably to the music.</p>

<p>The villagers look on, some standing, others sitting. At the close of
the dance, the crier says to the people, "Come quickly with the presents
which you have promised. They will go soon." Then the people
bring the horses and other presents, which they bestow upon the visitors,
who lose no time in departing for home. Then the child's face is
cleansed of the paint, and the two calumets are given to the family to
which the child belongs. The visitors generally depart before noon,
say, about 10 o'clock. Sometimes they finish the ceremony in three
days, in which case one day is spent in feasting, one in making presents,
and part of the third day in the dance. Sometimes they spend three
days in feasting, the fourth in making presents, and part of the fifth in
dancing. But the usual order is two days in feasting, one in making
presents, and part of the fourth in dancing.</p>

<p id="s126">§ 126. <i>Adoption and privileges of the child.</i>&mdash;This child is ever after
treated as the first-born, taking the place of the real first-born, who
calls him "ji<sup>n</sup>¢éha," <i>elder brother</i>. The wáwa<sup>n</sup> aká shares his property
with this adopted son, giving him presents, and never refusing
him anything that he may ask of him. In like manner, the real father
of the child makes presents to the real son of the wawa<sup>n</sup> aka, just as if
he were the child's father. This ceremony is never trifled with, though
it is now obsolescent. No marriage can take place between members
of these families for four years. At least, La Flèche and Two Crows
never heard of any persons marrying who were related by this sort of
kinship. After the first generation has passed away, the next may say,
"That man's father, A, made me (C) his son. I will dance for D, the
child of B, my adopted brother and son of A." Or B may say to C,
"My father, A, danced for you. Do you dance for me in the person of
my son, D." So the kinship used to be kept up, generation after generation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
if they liked one another; but if they did not agree, it was allowed
to disappear. (See Kinship, § <a href="#s78">78</a>.)</p>

<p>A child is danced for but once by the same party. Should they come
again, there are no ceremonies observed but the giving of horses and
goods. The children thus honored are from five to six years of age,
none over ten years of age can be thus adopted.</p>

<p>Frank La Flèche said, "Cañge-sk&#259; danced this dance for my father,
who therefore, called him 'father'; and I, too, call Cañge-sk&#259; my father.
So all the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte people (being my father's gens by adoption), called
Cañge-sk&#259;, 'father' for four years. Then the kinship ceased. During
that period it would have been unlawful for any of my family to intermarry
with the gens of Cañge-sk&#259;."</p>

<p>The Ponkas are not fully acquainted with the calumet dance. They
use but one pipe; but the Omahas always have two pipes.

<small>INDUSTRIAL OCCUPATIONS.</small></h2>

<p id="s127">§ 127. Industrial occupations among the ₵egiha may be treated of in
three grand divisions: I. Those relating to the Sustenance of Life;
II. Those concerning the Protection of Life; III. Those which have to
do with the Regulation of Life. The first and second of these divisions
are not fully differentiated.</p>

<p>To the first division may be assigned those industries pertaining to
Food, Clothing, and Shelter. Food is obtained by hunting, trapping,
fishing, and cultivation of the ground. In order to obtain it one is
obliged to resort to weapons, traps, farming implements, &amp;c.; and to
prepare it for a meal, there are several processes required, as well as
implements or utensils used in those processes. This gives rise to
another kind of industry, the manufacture of those weapons, traps,
implements, and utensils.</p>

<p>Among the industries pertaining to the Protection of Life are War
Customs (especially defensive warfare) and the Practice of Medicine.
(See Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">IX</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_X">X</a>.)</p>

<p>The following are connected with the Regulation of Life: The Government
and the Law. (See Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">XI</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">XII</a>.)</p>

<p>The following relate to the Sustenance of Life.</p>

<h3 id="HUNTING_CUSTOMS">HUNTING CUSTOMS.</h3>

<p id="s128">§ 128. <i>Kinds of hunting.</i>&mdash;There are two kinds of hunting known
among the ₵egiha. One is called "abae," answering to the [T]ᴐiwere
"kinañʞra," and the "wotihni" of the Dakotas. This refers to the
hunting of the larger animals by a few men, or even by one person, the
family of each hunter having been left at home or in the tribal camp.
The other kind is the "ʇe une," when all the people go in a body, with
their families, moving from place to place as they seek for herds of
buffaloes. This latter is often called "gaq¢a<sup>n</sup>´" by the Omahas and
Ponkas, and "ʞiqra<sup>n</sup>´" by the [T]ᴐiwere tribes.</p>

<p id="s129">§ 129. <i>Hunting seasons.</i>&mdash;The summer hunt was not undertaken till
the corn and pumpkins had been planted, the weeds cut, and the beans
gathered. The time for the return was when the wind blew open the
"jáqcazi," the sunflowers and the flowers of other species of the "ja,"
which was about the first of September. It was only during the summer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
hunt that the tribe camped in the tribal circle on the open prairie.
The fall or winter hunt gave a name to the season when it began "t`a<sup>n</sup>gaq¢a<sup>n</sup>,"
the <i>hunting fall</i>, or <i>later fall</i>, as distinguished from "t`a<sup>n</sup>" the
<i>harvest</i> or <i>earlier fall</i>. This later fall corresponded with the latter part
of October. Then some of the men took their families with them, and
went in pursuit of deer, or occupied themselves with trapping beaver
and otter. But most of the people went on the fall hunt when they
sought the "mé-ha," literally, "spring hides," that is, those which had
thick hair. They did not camp in the tribal circle, as it was too cold
to pitch their tents on the open prairie; but each head of a family had
his tent pitched in a sheltered spot; and for this purpose the hunters
did not always go in one large party, but scattered in several directions,
camping wherever they could find heavy timber or brush that could
protect their lodges during heavy winds. They returned home in the
spring about the month of April.</p>

<p id="s130">§ 130. <i>Preliminary feast held before the departure for the summer hunt.</i>&mdash;The
principal chief or head man of the Hañga gens prepared a feast, to
which he invited all the chiefs and brave men. An Iñke-sabě man was
sent as ieki¢ě (crier, herald) or wag¢a (messenger) around the village,
and he called to each guest to bring his bowl and spoon. When the
guests had assembled at the lodge of the Hañga chief the two principal
chiefs sat at the back of the lodge, opposite the entrance, and on each
side of them were ranged the subordinate chiefs around the circle, according
to their rank. After them were seated the braves, as far as the
entrance, on the left side of which sat the giver of the feast, while on
the right side were the wag¢a (Waka<sup>n</sup>-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup> and [T]eha<sup>n</sup>-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>, the
keepers of the sacred tents of the Hañga), who were expected to attend
to the fire and the kettles. The sacred pipes were lighted, according to
the prescribed rules, and passed around the circle. (See §§ <a href="#s18">18</a> and <a href="#s111">111</a>.)</p>

<p>The object of the council was explained by one of the head chiefs saying,
"Come! consider the question. Let us remove. In how many
days shall we remove?" The question was then discussed by others,
and having agreed among themselves what course to pursue, one said,
"Úqě ctĭ g¢íta<sup>n</sup>i ʞĭ, wata<sup>n</sup>´ zi-hi ctĭ g¢íta<sup>n</sup>i ʞĭ, dúba ja<sup>n</sup>´ ʞí, a<sup>n</sup>wa<sup>n</sup>´ha<sup>n</sup>taí"&mdash;<i>When
they have prepared their caches and have worked</i> (<i>i. e.</i>, examined)
<i>their cornstalks, let us remove after an interval of four days</i>. When
the chiefs perceived what was the sense of the council they decided on
the route. When the food was sufficiently cooked the wag¢a removed
the kettles from the fire. Then one of the head chiefs called a young
man by name, saying, "Úha<sup>n</sup> cétě we´¢itañ´-g&#259;," <i>Handle that kettle for
us</i>. Then the young man holding a spoon in his right hand dipped it
into one of the kettles, took out a piece of a choice part of the meat.
His left hand being elevated, with extended palm, he presented the
meat in the spoon to each of the four winds, beginning at the entrance
of the lodge, and he finished the ceremony by casting the meat into the
fire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>

<p>Then the food was served out to the guests, the best portions of it
being placed before the chiefs. Each person who received a portion
thanked the host, using the appropriate kinship term, as, "Hau! ji<sup>n</sup>¢éha!"
<i>Thanks! elder brother!</i>&mdash;"Hau! kagé!" <i>Thanks! younger brother!</i>&mdash;"Hau!
negíha!" <i>Thanks! mother's brother!</i> The old men present
thanked the host, chiefs, and young men. Food is precious to them, so
they talked a long time about it. The young men left some of the food
in the kettles for the criers and old men, who then ate out of the kettles
instead of bowls. The feast ended, smoking succeeded, after which
the guests rose in succession, thanked the host, and passed out of the
lodge in an orderly manner, beginning with those on the left of the entrance
and fireplace. These passed in single file before the head chiefs,
and round the rest of the circle of the guests, till they reached the entrance
when they passed out. Then those on the right of the fireplace
made a complete circuit of the lodge, passed before the head chiefs and
went out of the lodge. In each case the guest followed the course of
the sun as he appears to revolve around the earth. The criers sang
through the village in praise of the host, whom they thanked for his
hospitality. They also thanked the chiefs and young men who were
present at the feast; and they proclaimed to the people the decision of
the council.</p>

<p id="s131">§ 131. <i>Preparations for the departure.</i>&mdash;The women buried in <i>caches</i>
whatever they wished to leave. Food, etc., was placed in a blanket,
which was gathered up at the corners and tied with a thong; then the
bundle was allowed to fall to the bottom of the <i>cache</i>. Many of such
bundles were put into a single <i>cache</i>. Then the women went over the
corn-fields to see that all the work had been finished. They prepared
their pack-saddles and litters, and mended moccasins and other clothing.
The young men spent part of the time in dancing in honor of the
"watcígaxe ʇi uné¢ě aká," the men at whose lodges the dancing societies
met.</p>

<p id="s132">§ 132. <i>The departure.</i>&mdash;The day for their departure having arrived,
the women loaded their horses and dogs, and took as great weights on
their own backs as they could conveniently transport. Such lodges as
were left unoccupied by aged or infirm people were secured by closing
the entrances with large quantities of brushwood. Those men who
were the owners of many horses were able to mount their families on
horseback, but the most of the people were obliged to go afoot. Before
starting the place for passing the night was determined and an
Iñke-sabě man was sent through the village as crier saying, "Maja<sup>n</sup>´
gá¢ua[p]i ¢aʇí te,ai,a¢a+!"&mdash;<i>They say, indeed, that you shall pitch the tents
in that land which is out of sight!</i> He described the location of the
place as he made this proclamation, so that the abaé-ma (hunters or
scouts) might know where they were expected to rejoin the people.
This precaution was taken each succeeding night, or else on the morrow
before the departure of the hunters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span></p>

<p id="s133">§ 133. <i>The Hu¢uga or Tribal Circle.</i>&mdash;(See §§ <a href="#s9">9</a>-<a href="#s12">12</a>). They generally
selected some place near a stream, and they tried to find a level spot
large enough to allow the formation of a single hu¢uga, but when so
large a level could not be had, the Omahas pitched their lodges in two
concentric circles, and the Ponkas in three circles of that arrangement.
The exact order of the encampment of the gentes in these concentric
circles has not been preserved. As soon as the tents were erected each
woman put up her wáma<sup>n</sup>cíha, of which there were two or three for
each tent. They were used for drying the ʇanuʞa or fresh meat, and
each was made by sticking into the ground two forked sticks that were
about four feet high, about six or eight feet apart, and placing a pole
across them. The pieces of meat were hung across the transverse pole
of each wama<sup>n</sup>ciha.</p>

<p>After the setting up of the tent of one of the keepers of the wa¢íxabe
or sacred bags, a stick was thrust in the ground outside the tent, and
the wa¢ixabe was hung on it, provided there was no rain. But should
a rain ensue after the bag was hung outside, or if it was raining at the
time the tent was pitched, the stick was set up without delay within
the tent, and the bag was hung on it.</p>

<p id="s134">§ 134. <i>The Wa¢a<sup>n</sup> or directors of the hunt</i>.&mdash;The chiefs always appointed
four men to act as directors of the hunt. He who wished to
be the principal director had to provide a pipe and a standard called
the "wacábe." The former had a bowl of red pipe-stone, but was not
one of the sacred pipes. The latter consisted of an oak or hickory stick
about eight feet long, and reddened, to which was fastened a row of
eagle feathers, some of which were white and others spotted. Their
use will be explained hereafter. A "nikide" (see § <a href="#s151">151</a>) was fastened
to the top of the stick. The chiefs said to the directors, "It is good
to do such and such things." The directors considered whether it
would be right or not, and finally decided what course should be pursued.
Then, if any accident occurred, or quarrels between men or
women, dog fights, high winds, rain, etc., ensued, the director who had
advised going in that direction was blamed, and his advice was disregarded
from that time, so he had to resign, and let some one else take
his place. During the last summer hunt of the Omahas the directors
were Ictá¢abi, Nugá, and Duba-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>, of the Iñke-sabě gens, and a
fourth man, whose name has been forgotten. Icta¢abi succeeded his
father as the principal director.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p id="s135">§ 135. When the people stopped and camped for only a single night,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
the act was called "uʇi;" but when they stopped at a place for two or
more days, the act was known as "epaze." This latter happened when
the horses were tired or the weather was bad. "Uʇí dúba sát&#259;<sup>n</sup> da<sup>n</sup>´ctěa<sup>n</sup>´
ʞĭ, épazai"&mdash;<i>When they had camped but one night at each place for
four or five nights, they stopped to rest for two or more days.</i></p>

<p id="s136">§ 136. <i>Appointment of the scouts.</i>&mdash;It was generally two or three weeks
after the departure from the village that they reached the country
where the buffalo abounded. Meanwhile, the people were frequently
in need of food, so it was customary for some of the men to leave the
camp each morning to seek game of any kind for the sustenance of the
tribe till the buffalo herds were surrounded. This service, too, was
sometimes called "abae," and, also, "wada<sup>n</sup>´be ¢é," <i>to go to see</i> or <i>scout</i>;
and the men were "ábaé-ma" or "wada<sup>n</sup>´be-ma." Before their departure
they were summoned to the Wacabe tent by Tcáhĭc, the aged Iñke-sabě
crier, who stood by that tent, and called for each man in a loud
voice. The man himself was not named, but the name called was that
of his small son. Thus, when Two Crows was summoned, Tcahĭc said,
"Gai<sup>n</sup>-bajĭ hau+!" as the latter was then the young son of Two Crows,
and the father knew that he was summoned. When the fathers had
assembled at the Wacabe tent, each one was thus addressed by the
principal director: "You shall go as a scout. No matter what thing
you see, you shall report it just as it is. If you do not tell the truth
may you be struck by lightning! May snakes bite you! May men
slay you! May your feet hurt you! May your horse throw you!"
When the sons are large enough they go themselves as scouts when
called by name.</p>

<p>These scouts or hunters were expected to bring to the camp what
game they killed, and to reconnoiter the surrounding country for buffalo
and enemies. They used to traverse a vast extent of country, and to
shoot at all animals except the buffalo. Whenever those who went the
farthest came in sight of the buffalo, or discovered signs of their proximity,
they dared not shoot at the animals, but they were bound to
return at once to the tribe to report the fact. When they got in sight
of the camp, or of the tribe in motion, they made signs with their blankets
or robes. (See First Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology.
Sign Language, p. 532.)</p>

<p id="s137">§ 137. <i>Return of the scouts when the tents are pitched.</i>&mdash;If the tents were
pitched when the scouts came in sight, the latter went at once to the
Wacabe tent, where the ʇe-sa<sup>n</sup>-ha is kept. As soon as each director
heard or learnt of the coming of the scouts, he proceeded to the Wacabe
tent. When all four had arrived the scouts made a report. They never
told any news on such occasion till they reached the sacred tent; and
when they reported, they did not say, "We saw buffalo." They had to
say, if they discovered a herd, "Úciáʞi¢é-dega<sup>n</sup>, ʇé-i eb¢éga<sup>n</sup>"&mdash;<i>I may
have deceived myself, but I think that they were buffaloes.</i> The words
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
are pronounced very deliberately. "How many were there?" said the
directors. The reply might be, "I think about forty."</p>

<p>They were afraid of telling a falsehood to the directors and the keeper
of the sacred tent. Big Elk said that when they reported they used to
give a good robe to the pole in the other sacred tent, but this is denied
by La Flèche and Two Crows.</p>

<p>After hearing the report the directors sent the crier for the chiefs,
who assembled at the Wacabe tent. He also proclaimed that all the
young men should go thither; so they went, and stood outside. The
Hañga man (the keeper of the sacred tent?) told the young men, "In
such a direction there are so many buffaloes." Then the men left the
women in the camp, mounted their horses, and hastened towards the
herd.</p>

<p id="s138">§ 138. <i>Return of the scouts when the people are moving.</i>&mdash;If the people
were moving along when the scouts came in sight, the four directors
proceeded in advance to meet the scouts, and the Iñke-sabě crier accompanied
them. He marched behind the directors till they met the
scouts, when he advanced to the front, and received the report from
one of the scouts, who spoke in a whisper. Then the crier whispered
the news to the principal director, who stood on his left, and he whispered
it to the next director, and so on. After the crier told the first
director, the former stepped backward several paces to the rear of the
four directors, and lay down with his head pointing in the direction
whence the scouts came. After all of the directors heard the news,
they smoked once, and then sent the crier to proclaim the news. The
scouts proceeded to their families after delivering their report to the
directors. The crier proclaimed thus: "₵ázige te, ai a¢a+!" That is,
"They say indeed that you shall halt!" The tents were pitched immediately,
as the people knew that a herd of buffaloes had been found.
Then the men hastened toward the herd, each one being mounted.</p>

<p id="s139">§ 139. Some of the men used to address their horses thus: "Ho, my
child! do your best. I shall do my best." This was not said by all.
Some gave medicine to their horses to make them swift. (See the
[P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-wasabe dance, Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_X">X</a>.)</p>

<p id="s140">§ 140. <i>Council and appointment of policemen.</i>&mdash;As soon as they could
see the herd they stopped. Then the crier called certain young men by
name, saying, "Let us consecrate some ʇa or sides of buffalo meat.
You will take a ʇa for me." (See § <a href="#s151">151</a>.) A council was held by the
chiefs and directors, and having decided to surround the herd, policemen
were appointed. These wanace were selected from the wahehajĭ
or brave men. They had no work to do till they were near the herd.
Then they had to watch the people to keep them from scaring off the
herd by moving before the proper time. All who disobeyed them were
severely punished. Cáda¢íce, an aged Omaha, who is now lame and
palsied in one limb, was once strong and highly esteemed by his people;
but he violated the rules of the hunt, and all the policemen flogged him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
so unmercifully that he never fully recovered from the effects of his
punishment. The offense was committed when the people had been unsuccessful
in finding a herd, and were almost starved. Suddenly some
buffaloes were discovered. Though it was against the law for any small
number of men to go against the herd, independently of the rest, two
or three, including Cada¢ice, disobeyed, and, rushing forward, scared
off the herd, so that none were caught. On another hunt, when the
men were behind a bank, seven of them wished to ascend the hill sooner
than Two Crows directed. They started up against his wishes; but he
rushed after them and lashed them right and left with his whip, compelling
them to desist.</p>

<p>During the council the chiefs said, "Let us consecrate some buffalo
tongues, and also two or four hearts." Then, calling on two of the young
men, they said, "Young men, you will get the hearts and tongues for
us, and place them together at the sacred tent."</p>

<p id="s141">§ 141. <i>Order of approaching and surrounding a herd.</i>&mdash;The attacking
party was always led by two men carrying the sacred objects belonging
to the principal director; one man carried the pipe, and the
other bore the wacabe standard. They marched abreast, and behind
them came the two young men who had been chosen to collect the hearts
and tongues. The latter wore no clothing but their breech-cloths, and
they carried only their bows and knives. Behind them came the hunters,
not going abreast or in any fixed order, but somewhat scattered.
When the two leaders reached the proper distance from the herd they
separated, one going to the right and the other to the left, each one
proceeding in a course nearly the shape of a semi-circle, and followed by
half of the men. They began to form their lines for surrounding the
herd, and the leaders ran on till they had met in the rear of the herd,
and then passed one another, going a short distance around on the opposite
side. Then the attack began. The bearers of the pipe and
standard were called "`A<sup>n</sup>´sagi-ma," <i>the swift ones</i>.</p>

<p id="s142">§ 142. <i>Collection of the hearts and tongues.</i>&mdash;After they separated in
front of the herd the two young men behind them did not follow them,
but kept straight ahead towards the front of the herd, where they
stopped. They were obliged to be constantly on the alert in order to
avoid the onset of any buffalo that might rush towards them. As soon
as they saw that an animal was down they rushed towards it and proceeded
to cut out the heart and tongue. Then they passed to the next
one that was slain, and so on. Each one cut out eight or ten tongues,
but he was obliged to cut a hole in the throat before taking out the
tongue, which was drawn through that hole. This was the last time that
the tongues could touch any tool or metal, except when they were boiling
in the kettles at the sacred tent. As fast as the men removed the
hearts and tongues they cut holes in them, through which was thrust
one end of a bow. When all were strung on the bows they were secured
by tying pieces of green hide to the ends of each bow. The bow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
and its burden was placed on the back of the owner while the green
hide or bow-string went across the chest. Then the young men ran
quickly in advance of the hunters and gave the hearts and tongues to
the keeper of the Wacabe tent.</p>

<p id="s143">§ 143. <i>The feast on the hearts and tongues.</i>&mdash;In the evening, when all
the policemen and other hunters had returned to the camp, the two
keepers of the Hañga sacred tents boiled the hearts and tongues. As
soon as they were done an Iñke-sabě man was sent as crier to invite the
chiefs, who proceeded to the Wacabe tent. On some of these occasions
all of the chiefs and Hañga men did not attend, so, when there were many
tongues, and few chiefs were present, some of the brave young men
were invited to assist in consuming the sacred food. None of the Wacabe
Hañga could eat the sacred tongues, though any of the other
Hañga who were present might do so. None of the meat was then cut
with a knife. Each guest was obliged to eat his portion there, as he
could not take it to his own lodge. He must put one corner of his robe
(the wai<sup>n</sup>hahage or lower part) on the ground, and having placed the
piece of meat on that, he had to raise the improvised dish to his mouth
and bite off a mouthful at a time. Even when the blanket was a new
one that would be soiled the wearer could not avoid using it thus. This
ceremony was observed four times during the summer hunt. After the
surrounding of the fourth herd there were no further prohibitions of
the use of a knife or bowl during that season.</p>

<p>When the people divide and go in two parties during the summer
hunting season, only those who have the sacred tents observe the ceremonies
which have just been described. The others did not consecrate
any hearts and tongues.</p>

<p>While the guests were eating certain sacred songs were sung. According
to La Flèche and Two Crows, the singers were two of the Wacabe
Hañga and the ₵atada man who acted as quʞa; but Frank La
Flèche says that the singers were the Hañga guests who ate the
tongues.</p>

<p>The Iñke-sabě crier sat by the door, looking wistfully towards the
food, and hoping almost against hope for some to be left for him.</p>

<p>These songs were very many, and lasted till daylight, according to
A<sup>n</sup>´ba-hébe, the tribal historian. From him the writer gained an incomplete
description of them. First were the corn songs: 1. "I clear the
land." 2. "I put in corn." 3. "The corn comes up." 4. "Ukít`ět`a<sup>n</sup>,
<i>It has blades</i>." 5. "Q¢á é¢a<sup>n</sup>be, <i>The ears appear</i>." 6. "Wahába najíha
t`a<sup>n</sup>, <i>The ears have hair</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, silk." 7. "Égi¢e a<sup>n</sup>´¢ispa<sup>n</sup>, <i>At length we
try the ears, squeezing them with the fingers, to see if they are ripe</i>." 8.
"Égi¢e jút`a<sup>n</sup> ʞĭ, <i>At length it is ripe</i>." 9. "Égi¢e wahába a<sup>n</sup>´¢ija, <i>At
length we pull off the ears from the stalks</i>." 10. "Égi¢e wahába a<sup>n</sup>´¢iga,
<i>At length we husk the ears</i>." 11. "Égi¢e wahába a<sup>n</sup>´¢icpi, <i>At length we
shell the corn</i>." 12. "Égi¢e wahába a<sup>n</sup>´¢ate, <i>At length we eat the corn</i>."</p>

<p>Then followed the buffalo songs in similar order, of which were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
the following: "Síg¢e wada<sup>n</sup>´be, <i>The tracks are seen</i>." "[T]é wada<sup>n</sup>´be
ag¢í, <i>They have come back from seeing the buffalo</i>." "[P]ahé ʇá[p]`ě a¢ai´,
<i>They have gone to the hill that is near by</i>." * * * "[T]e wi<sup>n</sup> aú h&#259;,
<i>I have wounded a buffalo</i>." "Húqpaqpa ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>´, <i>He walks coughing
repeatedly</i>." This last refers to a habit of wounded buffaloes, they cough
repeatedly as the blood pours forth.</p>

<p>La Flèche and Two Crows say that they never attended these feasts,
so they cannot give the words of the songs. Frank La Flèche says,
"None besides the Hañgas and chiefs can give you correctly all of the
songs of the corn and buffalo, as it is looked upon as sacrilege to sing
these songs. The young people are strictly forbidden to sing them.
None of the young Omahas have taken any pains to learn them, although
we have often been to listen to the singing of them while the Hañgas
and the chiefs were performing the ceremonies of the pole. You may,
but I very much doubt it, get it all from one of the Hañgas or chiefs
by liberally compensating him for his patience (of which I fear he
wouldn't have enough) in going through with it, as it takes three or
four nights without stopping, lasting from sundown till sunrise; and
even then they find, sometimes, that they have omitted some.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> I myself
would like to know it all, but I have never once heard it sung by
any of the young men with whom I am accustomed to go, although they
frequently have had the presumption to sing all other religious songs,
such as the I<sup>n</sup>´-kug¢i a¢i<sup>n</sup>´, Wacícka a¢i<sup>n</sup>´, Wasé a¢i<sup>n</sup>´, etc., for amusement."</p>

<p id="s144">§ 144. <i>Skill in archery.</i>&mdash;So great is the skill of the Indians in archery,
that they frequently sent their arrows completely through the bodies
of the animals at which they shot, the arrowheads appearing in such
cases on the opposite side. Dougherty heard that in some instances
the arrows were sent with such force that they not only passed entirely
through the bodies of the buffaloes, but even went flying through the
air or fell to the ground beyond the animals.</p>

<p id="s145">§ 145. <i>Sets of arrows.</i>&mdash;As each man had his own set of arrows distinguished
from those of other men by peculiar marks, he had no difficulty
in recovering them after the slaughter of the herd, and by means
of them he could tell which animals were killed by him. Hence quarrels
respecting the right of property in game seldom occurred, and the
carcass was awarded to the more fortunate person whose arrow pierced
the most vital part.</p>

<p id="s146">§ 146. Frank La Flèche killed his first buffalo when he was but seventeen
years of age. On such occasions the slayer cut open the body
and ate the liver with the gall over it.</p>

<p id="s147">§ 147. <i>Carving and division of a buffalo.</i>&mdash;When plenty of buffalo had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
been killed, the slayer of one took but one man to aid him in cutting it
up, and each man took half of the body as his share. All agree in saying
that the hide was kept by the slayer, and some say that the choice
pieces were also his. Sometimes the slayer gave pieces of the meat to
those of his kindred who had no horses. All recognize the right of the
slayer to give the pieces as he saw best. He was generally assisted in
the cutting up by four or five men, and the body was divided into six
portions, as follows: The ʇe-mañ´ge or chest, one share; the ʇe-na<sup>n</sup>´qa
or hump, one share; the ʇe-ju´ or front portions of the body, two shares,
with each of which was put a foreleg; the ʇe-jéga or thighs, the hinder
portions of the body, two shares; with one was put the ʇe-níxa or
paunch, with the other, the ʇe-cíbe or entrails. The men who assisted
were not necessarily of the same gens or tribe. Sometimes the slayer
took only the hide for his part and gave all the rest away. According
to Frank La Flèche, "the first man who reached a slain buffalo had for
his share, if the animal was fat, one of the ʇe-ju and the ʇe-nixa; but if
it was lean, he took one of the ʇe-jega and the ʇe-nixa. The second man
that reached there received the other ʇe-ju, and the third had the ʇe-mañge.
The fourth one's share consisted of the ʇa<sup>n</sup>´he or ʇe-cibe and
the other ʇe-jega. But if the slayer of the animal wished any of these
parts he could keep them. The ʇe-dí or liver was good for nothing."</p>

<p>Should only one buffalo be killed by a large party, say, thirty or more,
the slayer always cut up the body in many pieces of equal size and divided
among all the hunters. Sometimes two or three men came and
helped the slayer to carve the body. Then he gave each a share. If a
chief who had not been invited to sit down came and assisted in the carving,
he too would get a share; but he had no right to demand a part,
much less the whole body, for himself, as some writers assert. When a
chief approached a carcass the slayer, if he chose, could tell him to sit
down. Then the slayer, after cutting up the body, might give a piece
to the chief, saying, "Take that and carry it on your back." Then the
chief would thank the donor. If the chief could not tell in public of the
kindness of his benefactor, the slayer would not give him a piece of the
meat. When a man killed a buffalo, elk, deer, beaver, or otter, he
might carry it to a chief, and say, "Wi´[p]aha<sup>n</sup>, <i>I give it to you</i>."</p>

<p id="s148">§ 148. The women never aided in the carving. Sometimes, when a
man had no boy to take care of his extra horse, he let his wife ride it,
and allowed her to take out the entrails, etc., after he had slit the belly.
But if the slayer offered any objection the woman could not do that.
As a rule the men took out "úgaqe¢a tě," or all the intestines, including
the paunch, ʇe-cibe, etc., and put them aside for the women to uncoil
and straighten.</p>

<p id="s149">§ 149. <i>Kinds of buffaloes eaten.</i>&mdash;During the winter hunt young buffalo
bulls were eaten, as they were fat, but the full-grown bulls were
never eaten, as their flesh was too hard. So in summer the young bulls
were not eaten for the same reason. Buffalo cows were always in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
good condition for eating, and so were the "ʇe-mi<sup>n</sup>quga" or hermaphrodite
buffaloes. The latter had very long horns.</p>

<p>While the Ponkas and Dakotas, when pressed by hunger, might eat
the kidneys raw, the Omahas always boiled them before eating.</p>

<p id="s150">§ 150. <i>Disposition of the various parts of the buffalo.</i>&mdash;With the exceptions
of the feet and head, all the edible parts of the animal were carried
to the camp and preserved. The brains (wé¢iq¢i) were taken from
the skull for the purpose of dressing (¢iq¢í) the skin or converting it
into leather. These skins, which were obtained during this season,
were called "ʇa´ha," and were used in the construction of the skin
lodges, as well as for their individual clothing during the warm weather.
When but few animals were killed even the feet were taken to the camp,
and when they were boiled till they came apart they were eaten.</p>

<p>According to Dougherty "three women sufficed for carrying all the
pieces of a buffalo, except the skin, to the camp if it was at any moderate
distance, and it was their duty to prepare the meat, etc., for keeping."
But Frank La Flèche says that the women seldom went out to
bring in the packs of meat. Men and boys usually carried them. A
woman who had any male kindred used to ask some of the younger ones
to take her husband's horses and go for the meat.</p>

<p>All the meat could be cut into thin slices, placed on low scaffolds, and
dried in the sun or over a slow fire. Some, who did not know how to cut
good slices, used to cut the ʇe-mañge into strips about two inches wide,
called "wá[s]nege." But those who knew how would cut them in three,
long slices (wága) for drying. "The bones of the thighs, to which a
small quantity of meat was left adhering, were placed before the fire
till the meat was sufficiently roasted, when they were broken. The
meat and the marrow were considered a most delicious repast. These,
with the tongue and hump, were considered the best parts of the animals.
The meat, in its dried state, was closely compressed into quadrangular
packages, each of the proper size to attach conveniently to
one side of the pack-saddle of a horse. The dried intestines were interwoven
together into the form of mats and tied up in packages of similar
form and size." Then the women put these supplies in <i>caches</i>, and
the tribe continued onward in the pursuit of other herds. (For a fuller
account of the uses of the different parts of the buffalo meat see Chapter
<a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">VIII</a>, § <a href="#s164">164</a>.)</p>

<p id="s151">§ 151. <i>Ceremonies of thanksgiving prior to the return home. Anointing
the sacred pole.</i>&mdash;It will be noticed that on the way to the hunt, and until
the time for the greasing or anointing of the sacred pole, the Wacabe
tent is the more important one. But after that a change occurred. The
keeper of the other sacred tent, in which is the sacred pole, became the
master of ceremonies, and the keeper of the Wacabe tent acted as his
assistant. When the people had killed a great many buffaloes they
were willing to return to their home. But before they could start they
must take part in a religious ceremony, of which a partial description
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
follows. The keeper of the pole sent a crier to summon the chiefs, who
assembled and decided to perform the sacred rites. For this purpose
a "ʇa" was boiled at the sacred tents. About a hundred young men
were collected there. They who had not yet distinguished themselves
in battle went stripped to the waist, and sat in a circle around the tents.
Here and there were some of the braves who wore robes, and some had
on good shirts. They departed when they had eaten the food. As they
followed the line of the tents several women went after them. Two of
these women were they who carried the sacred tents, and with them
were three or five others. As the braves proceeded they snatched from
each "ʇi-ú¢igije" or "ʇí-u¢ipu" (high or low tent) a tent-pole or else a
forked stick (ísag¢e) such as were used for hanging the kettles. No one
offered any resistance, as they knew the purpose for which the sticks were
taken. These tent-poles and isag¢e were handed to the women, who
carried them to the keepers of the sacred tents. When they arrived
there they used the sticks for making a long tent; and they placed the
sacred pole directly in front of the tent, as in the figure. Then the crier
(Tcahĭc) stood at the long tent and proclaimed as follows, by command
of the keeper of the sacred pole, calling on each small child by name:
"O grandchild, wherever you are standing, even though you bring but
one thing, you will put it yonder on the ground for me at a short distance."
Over two hundred children of parents that were prosperous
were thus invited to make presents to the sacred tents. No children
of poor people were expected to make any presents, but young men,
boys, girls, and even infants, were expected to bring "ʇa" or their
equivalents, if they could afford them. Then came the young men whom
the crier had named when they first saw the buffaloes. (See § <a href="#s140">140</a>.)
Each one brought a "ʇe-ju" or side of a buffalo. Sometimes they
brought back as many as thirty, forty, or fifty. Then came the fathers
with their children who had been called by name, each person bringing
four presents in the name of his child. These consisted, in modern
times, of a "ʇa," a gun, a fine robe, and a kettle. Each piece of "ʇa" used
at this ceremony was about a yard long and half a yard wide. When a
gun could not be had, "nikide," which were very precious, being used
for necklaces, were offered instead. Sometimes a horse was the fourth
gift. The wahehajĭ took "ʇa," and also horses or goods, as their offerings.
The keeper of the pole, who could not eat the "ʇa," then called
on the keeper of the Wacabe tent to act for him; and the latter then
proceeded to arrange the pieces of the "ʇa" before the pole. Selecting
the two pieces that were the fattest, he placed them before the pole, as
the "nuda<sup>n</sup>´hañga" or lords. Then he arranged the others in a row
with the two, parallel with the long tent. When but few buffaloes had
been killed, there was only one row of the "ʇa" before the pole; but when
there had been a very successful hunt, the pieces were spread in one and
a half, two, or even two and a half rows, each full row being the length
of the long tent. Then the keeper of the pole sent a man of his gens to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
the Iñke-sabě gens for the two sacred pipes. These were taken by the
Hañga man to the long tent for future use. In the mean time, the principal
pieces of the ʇa were cut by the keeper of the Wacabe tent in
pieces as wide as one hand, and as long as from the elbow to the tips
of the fingers (fully eighteen inches). These pieces of fat were mixed
with red clay, and then the compound was rubbed over the sacred pole.
Some say that throughout this ceremony sacred songs were sung: "A<sup>n</sup>´ba
i¢áug¢ěqti waa<sup>n</sup>´ g¢i<sup>n</sup>i," <i>They sat singing throughout the day</i>. (See
§ <a href="#s143">143</a> for what Frank La Flèche says on this point.) When the anointing
was completed the remaining ʇa were collected, and divided among
the Hañga people who could not eat the tongues. Sometimes the
chiefs received one apiece; and the keeper of the pole asked for one,
two, three, and sometimes four,
which he gave to the kindred of his
wife, as he could not eat that part
of the buffalo.</p>

pole, and rows of "ʇa" within the tribal circle.</p>

<p>Legend.&mdash;1, The tent; 2, The pole; 3, The rows of ʇa.</p>
</div>

<p>According to some, the keeper
of one of the Hañga sacred tents
prayed over the sacred object which
was tied upon the pole, extending
the palms of his hands towards it.
Then every one had to be silent
and keep at a certain distance from
the long tent. Inside that tent
were seated twelve men in a row.
(The writer suspects that ten chiefs,
one from each gens, and the two
keepers of the Hañga sacred tents
were the occupants of the long tent.
See below.) When the presents
were made to the sacred pole,
young girls led horses and brought
blankets to the two sacred men, and were allowed to touch the sacred
pole. The wife of a former trader at the Omaha Agency, when very
sick, was taken in a wagon to witness the praying before the sacred
pole, in hope that it might cause her recovery.</p>

<p id="s152">§ 152. <i>The sham fight.</i>&mdash;After the pole was anointed, the chiefs spoke
of pretending to engage with enemies. So a member of the [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze gens
(in modern times Mitcáqpe-jiñga or Maja<sup>n</sup>´ha-¢i<sup>n</sup> held this office) was
ordered by the keeper of the pole to summon the stout-hearted young
men to engage in the combat. Mitcaqpe-jiñga used to go to each brave
man and tell him quietly to come to take part in the fight. According
to some he proclaimed thus: "Ye young men, decorate yourselves and
come to play. Come and show yourselves." Then the young men assembled.
Some put on head-dresses of eagles' feathers, others wore
ornaments of crow feathers (and skins of coyotes) in their belts. Some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
decorated their horses. Some were armed with guns; others with bows
and arrows. The former loaded their weapons with powder alone; the
latter pulled their bow-strings, as if against foes, but did not shoot the
arrows.</p>

<p>The flaps of the skins in front of the long tent were raised from the
ground and kept up by means of the isag¢e or forked sticks. Within
the long tent were seated the chiefs (ten of them?&mdash;see above) and the
two keepers of the sacred tents. The chiefs had made four grass figures
in the shape of men, which they set up in front of the long tent.</p>

<p>After the young men assembled they rode out of the circle and went
back towards a hill. Then they used to send some one on foot to give
the alarm. This man ran very swiftly, waving his blanket, and saying,
"We are attacked!" All at once the horsemen appeared and came to
the tribal circle, around which they rode once. When they reached the
Weji<sup>n</sup>cte and Ictasanda tents they dispersed, each one going wherever
he pleased. Then the occupants of the long tent took the places of the
horsemen, being thenceforth regarded as Dakotas. As soon as the
horsemen dispersed the pursuers of the foe started out from all parts
of the tribal circle, hastening towards the front of the long tent to
attack the supposed Dakotas. These pursuers evidently included many
of the horsemen. They shot first at the grass figures, taking close aim
at them, and knocking them down each time that they fired. Having
shot four times at them, they dismounted and pretended to be cutting
up the bodies. This also was done four times. Next the pursuers
passed between the grass figures and the place where the "ʇa" had
been, in order to attack the occupants of the long tent. Four times did
they fire at one another, and then the shooting ceased. Then followed
the smoking of the two sacred pipes as tokens of peace. These were
filled by a member of the Hañga gens and lighted by some one else.
(See Sacred Pipes, § <a href="#s17">17</a>.) They were carried first to the chiefs in the
long tent, and then over to the young men representing the pursuers.
Here and there were those who smoked them. The pipes were taken
around four times. Then they were consigned by the keeper of the pole
to one of the men of his sub-gens, who took them back to their own
tent. When he departed he wrapped around them one of the offerings
made by the brave men to the sacred pole. He returned the bundle to
the keeper of the pipes without saying a word.</p>

<p>The writer has not been able to learn whether the ʇe-sa<sup>n</sup>-ha was ever
exposed to public gaze during this ceremony or at any other time.
Frank La Flèche does not know.</p>

<p>After the anointing of the pole (and the conclusion of the sham fight)
its keeper took it back to its tent. This was probably at or after the
time that the sacred pipes were returned to the Iñke-sabě tent.</p>

<p>The tent skins used for the covering of the long tent consisted of those
belonging to the two sacred tents of the Hañga, and of as many others
as were required.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span></p>

<p id="s153">§ 153. <i>The Hede-watci.</i>&mdash;Sometimes the ceremonies ended with the
sham fight, in which event the people started homeward, especially
when they were in a great hurry. But when time allowed the sham
fight was followed by a dance, called the Héde-watci[´]. When it occurred
it was not under the control of the keepers of the two sacred tents, but
of the Iñke-sabe keeper of the two sacred pipes.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day when the sham fight took place, the chiefs
generally assembled, and consulted together about having the dance.
But the proposition came from the keeper of the pipes. Then the
chiefs said, "It is good to dance." The dance was appointed for the
following day. On the morrow five, six, or seven of the Iñke-sabě men,
accompanied by one of their women, went in search of a suitable tree.
According to La Flèche and Two Crows, when the tree was found, the
woman felled it with her ax, and the men carried it on their shoulders
back to the camp, marching in Indian file. Frank La Flèche says that
the tree was cut during the evening previous to the dance; and early
the next morning, all the young men of the tribe ran a race to see who
could reach the tree first. (With this compare the tradition of the
race for the sacred pole, § <a href="#s36">36</a>, and the race for the tree, which is to
be used for the sun-dance, as practiced among the Dakotas). He also
says that when the sham fight ended early in the afternoon, the Hede-watci
could follow the same day. (In that event, the tree had to be
found and cut on the preceding day, and the race for it was held early
in the morning before the anointing of the sacred pole.) In the race
for the tree, the first young man who reached it and touched it, could
carry the larger end on his shoulder; the next one who reached it
walked behind the first as they bore the tree on their shoulders; and
so on with the others, as many as were needed to carry the tree, the
last one of whom had to touch the extreme end with the tips of his
fingers. The rest of the young men walked in single file after those
who bore the tree. Frank La Flèche never heard of the practice of any
sacred rites previous to the felling of the tree. Nothing was prepared
for the tree to fall on, nor did they cause the tree to fall in any particular
direction, as was the case when the Dakotas procured the tree for
the sun-dance.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>In the sun-dance, the man who dug the "ujéʇi" in the middle of the
tribal circle for the sun-pole had to be a brave man, and he was obliged
to pay for the privilege. Frank La Flèche could not tell whether there
were similar requirements in the case of him who dug the ujéʇi for the
pole in the Hede-watci; nor could he tell whether the man was always
chosen from the Iñke-sabě gens.</p>

<p>When the men who bore the tree reached the camp they planted it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
in the ujeʇi,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> or hole in the ground, which had been dug in the center
of the tribal circle. After the planting of the tree, from which the
topmost branches had not been cut, an old man of the gens was sent
around the tribal circle as crier. According to Big Elk, he said, "You
are to dance! You are to keep yourselves awake by using your feet!"
This implied that the dance was held at night; but Frank La Flèche
says that none of the regular dancing of the Hede-watci occurred at
night, though there might be other dancing then, as a sort of preparation
for the Hede-watci. In like manner, Miss Fletcher told of numerous
songs and dances, not part of the sun-dance, which preceded that
ceremony among the Dakotas.</p>

<p>The Iñke-sabě men cut some sticks in the neighborhood of their
tents and sent them around the camp, one being given to the chief of
each gens. Then the latter said to his kinsmen, "They have come to
give us the stick because they wish us to take part in the dance." Then
all the people assembled for the dance. In modern times, those who
thought much of themselves (chiefs and others) did not go to witness
this dance, but staid at home, as did Joseph La Flèche. Nearly all the
young men and boys wore nothing but their breech-cloths, and their
bodies were smeared over with white clay. Here and there were young
men who wore gay clothing. The women and girls wore good dresses,
and painted the partings of their hair and large round spots on their
cheeks with red paint. Near the pole were the elder men of the Iñke-sabě
gens, wearing robes with the hair outside; some of them acted as
singers and others beat the drums and rattles; they never used more
than one or two drums and four gourd rattles. It is not certain which Iñke-sabě
men acted as singers, and which ones beat the drums and rattles.
When Frank La Flèche witnessed this dance he says that the singers and
other musicians sat on the west side of the pole and outside the circle
of the dancers; but Joseph La Flèche, Two Crows, and Big Elk agreed
in saying that their place was within the circle of the dancers and near
the pole. This was probably the ancient rule, from which deviations
have been made in recent times. The two sacred pipes occupied important
places in this dance; each one was carried on the arm of a young
man of the gens, but it was not filled.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> These two young men were the
leaders of the dance, and from this circumstance originated the ancient
proper name, [T]a<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>ba, Two Running. According to Frank La
Flèche, these two young men began the dance on the west side of the pole,
standing between the pole and the singers. The songs of this dance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
were sacred, and so they are never sung except during this ceremony.
Of the members of the tribe, those on foot danced around the pole, while
those who wished to make presents were mounted and rode round and
round the circle of the dancers. The men and boys danced in a peculiar
course, going from west to south, thence east and north, but the
women and girls followed the course of the sun, dancing from the east
to the south, thence by the west to the north. The male dancers were
nearer the pole, while the females danced in an outer circle. When a
horseman wished to make a present he went to one of the bearers of the
sacred pipes, and, having taken the pipe by the stem, he held it toward
the man to whom he desired to give his horse. The man thus favored,
took the end of the stem into his mouth without touching it with his
hand and pretended to be smoking, while the other man held the pipe
for him ("ui¢a<sup>n</sup>"). The recipient of the gift then expressed his thanks
by extending his hands, with the palms towards the donor, saying,
"Hau, kageha!" <i>Thanks, my friend!</i> Each male dancer carried a stick of
hard willow trimmed at the bottom, but having the branches left at the
top (in imitation of the cottonwood pole). Each stick was about five feet
high, and was used as a staff or support by the dancers. After all had
danced four times around the circle, all the males threw their sticks toward
the pole; the young men threw theirs forcibly in sport, and covered
the heads of the singers and musicians, who tried to avoid the missiles;
This ended the ceremony, when all the people went to their respective
tents. Those who received the horses went through the camp,
yelling the praises of the donors.</p>

<p id="s154">§ 154. <i>Division of the tribe into two hunting parties during the summer
hunt.</i>&mdash;Sometimes the tribe divided, each party taking in a different
route in search of the buffalo. In such cases each party made its camping
circle, but without pitching the tents according to the gentes; all
consanguinities and affinities tried to get together. Those who belonged
to the party that did not have the two sacred Hañga tents could not
perform any of the ceremonies which have been described in §§ <a href="#s143">143</a> and
<a href="#s151">151</a>. All that they could do was to prepare the hides and meat for
future use. They had nothing to do with the anointing of the sacred
pole, sham fight, and Hede-watci, which ceremonies could not be performed
twice during the year.</p>

<p id="s155">§ 155. When the two parties came together again, if any person in
either party had been killed, some one would throw himself on the ground
as soon as they got in sight, as a token to the others of what had occurred.</p>

<p id="s156">§ 156. <i>Two tribes hunting together.</i>&mdash;Occasionally two tribes hunted
together, as was often the case with the Omahas and Ponkas. Frank
La Flèche says that when this was done some of the Ponkas joined the
Omahas in the sham fight; but he does not know whether the Ponkas
have similar ceremonies. They have no sacred pole, ʇe-sa<sup>n</sup>-ha, nor sacred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
tents, though they claim a share in the sacred pole of the Omahas, and
they have sacred pipes.</p>

<p id="s157">§ 157. <i>Hunting party attacked by foes.</i>&mdash;When a hunting party was suddenly
attacked by an enemy the women used to dig pits with their
knives or hoes, and stoop down in them in company with the children,
to avoid the missiles of the combatants. If the tribe was encamped at
the time, the pits were dug inside the tribal circle. Sometimes the
children were placed in such pits and covered with skins, over which
a quantity of loose earth was quickly thrown; and they remained concealed
till it was safe for them to come forth. On one occasion, when
the Dakotas had attacked the camp, an Omaha woman had not time
to cover the children with a skin and earth, so she threw herself over
them and pretended to be dead. The Dakotas on coming up thought
that she was dead, so they contented themselves with scalping her, to
which she submitted without a cry, and thus saved herself as well as
the children.</p>

<p>When there was danger of such attacks the people continued their
journey throughout the night. So the members of the different households
were constantly getting separated. Mothers were calling out in
the darkness for their little ones, and the young men replied in sport,
"Here am I, mother," imitating the voices of the children.</p>

<p id="s158">§ 158. <i>Return of the tribe from the summer hunt.</i>&mdash;The people started
homeward immediately after the sham fight and the Hede-watci. But
there were always four runners who were sent about five or six days in
advance of the main body. These runners were always volunteers.
They traveled all the time, each one carrying his own food. Not one
waited for the others. They never pitched a tent, but simply lay down
and slept. Whenever one waked, even though it was still night, he
started again, without disturbing the others if they were asleep. They
always brought pieces of meat to those who had remained at home. Their
approach was the signal for the cry, "Ikima<sup>n</sup>´¢i<sup>n</sup>  ag¢íi, hŭ<sup>n</sup>+!"&mdash;<i>The messengers
have come back, halloo!</i> In the course of a few days all of the
people reached home; but there were no religious ceremonies that ensued.
They always brought tongues to those who had staid at home.</p>

<p id="s159">§ 159. <i>Abae, or hunting the larger animals.</i>&mdash;No religious ceremonies
were observed when a man went from home for a few days in order to
procure game. The principal animals hunted by the Omahas and Ponkas
were the elk, deer, black bear, grizzly bear, and rabbit.</p>

<p>When a deer was killed it was generally divided into four parts.
Two parts were called the "ʇe-¢íʇi<sup>n</sup>" or ribs, with which were given the
fore legs and the "ʇe-na<sup>n</sup>´qa" or hump. Two parts were the "ʇe-jéga"
or thighs, <i>i. e.</i>, the hind quarters. When the party consisted of five
men the ʇe-na<sup>n</sup>qa was made the share of the fifth; and when there
were more persons present the fore legs were cut off as shares. When
an elk was killed it was generally divided into five parts. The "ʇe-ju"
or fore quarters were two parts, with which went the fore legs. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
ʇe-jega or hind quarters made two more parts, with one of which went
the paunch, and with the other the entrails. The ʇe-na<sup>n</sup>qa was the fifth
part; and when the elk was large a sixth share was formed by cutting
off the "ʇe-mañge" or chest.</p>

<p>Frank La Flèche does not know how the black bears used to be divided,
as there have been none found on the Omaha reservation for the
past fourteen years.</p>

<p id="s160">§ 160. If one shoots a wild turkey or goose (mi<sup>n</sup>xa), another person
standing near may run up and take the bird if he can get there first,
without saying anything. The slayer cannot say, "Give it to me." He
thinks that he can get the next one which he kills. The same rule applies
to a raccoon. But when one catches a beaver in a trap he does
not give it away.</p>

<p id="s161">§ 161. <i>Trapping.</i>&mdash;Since the coming of the white men the Omahas
have been making small houses or traps of sticks about a yard long,
for catching the miʞasi (prairie wolves), big wolves, gray foxes, and
even the wild cat.</p>

<h3 id="FISHING_CUSTOMS">FISHING CUSTOMS.</h3>

<p id="s162">§ 162. Before the advent of the white man the Omahas used to fish in
two ways. Sometimes they made wooden darts by sharpening long sticks
at one end, and with these they speared the fish. When the fish appeared
on the surface of the water they used to shoot them with a certain kind
of arrows, which they also used for killing deer and small game. They
spoke of the arrows as "násize gáxe," because of the way in which they
were prepared. No arrowheads were used. They cut the ends of the
shafts to points; then about four inches of the end of each arrow next
the point was held close to a fire, and it was turned round and round
till it was hardened by the heat.</p>

<p>Since the coming of the whites, the Omahas have learned to make
fishing-lines of twisted horsehair, and these last a long time. They do
not use sinkers and floats, and they never resort to poison for securing
the fish. Both Ponkas and Omahas have been accustomed to fish as
follows in the Missouri River: A man would fasten some bait to a hook
at the end of a line, which he threw out into the stream, after securing
the other end to a stake next the shore; but he took care to conceal the
place by not allowing the top of the stick to appear above the surface
of the water. Early the next morning he would go to examine his line,
and if he went soon enough he was apt to find he had caught a fish.
But others were on the watch, and very often they would go along the
bank of the river and feel under the water for the hidden sticks, from
which they would remove the fish before the arrival of the owner of the
lines.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span></p>

<p><i>Hú-bigide, weirs or traps for catching fish.</i>&mdash;La Flèche and Two Crows
do not think that this was an ancient practice. Children now catch
fish in this manner. They take a number of young willows of the
species called "¢íxe-sagi," or hard willow, and having bent them down,
they interlace them beneath the surface of the water. When the fish
attempt to force their way through they are often caught in the interstices,
which serve as meshes. But if the fish are large and swim on
the surface they can leap over and escape.</p>

<p>The Omahas eat the following varieties of fishes: ʇúzě, or Missouri
catfish; hu-í-buʇa, "round-mouthed-fish," or buffalo-fish; hu-hi<sup>n</sup>´pa, or
sturgeon; hú-[p]a-[s]néde, "long-nosed fish," or gar; and the hu-g¢éje, or
"spotted fish." The last abounds in lakes, and is generally from 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to
3 feet long. It has a long nose.</p>

<h3 id="CULTIVATION_OF_THE_GROUND">CULTIVATION OF THE GROUND.</h3>

<p id="s163">§ 163. This is regulated by the Hañga gens, as corn and the buffalo
meat are both of great importance, and they are celebrated in the sacred
songs of the Hañga when the feast is made after the offering of
the buffalo hearts and tongues. (§ <a href="#s143">143</a>.)</p>

<p>Corn is regarded as a "mother" and the buffalo as a "grandfather."
In the Osage tradition corn was bestowed on the people by four buffalo
bulls. (See Calumet dance, § <a href="#s123">123</a>, and several myths, in Part I, Contributions
to N. A. Ethnology, Vol. VI.)</p>

<p>At harvest one of the keepers of the Hañga sacred tents (Frank La
Flèche thinks it is the Wacabe or [T]e-sa<sup>n</sup>-ha keeper) selects a number
of ears of red corn, which he lays by for the next planting season. All
the ears must be perfect ones. (See Calumet dance, § <a href="#s123">123</a>.)</p>

<p>In the spring, when the grass comes up, there is a council or tribal
assembly held, to which a feast is given by the head of the Hañga gens.
After they decide that planting time has come, and at the command of
the Hañga man, a crier is sent through the village. He wears a robe with
the hair outside, and cries as he goes, "Wa¢a`e te, ai a¢á u+!"&mdash;<i>They
do indeed say that you will dig the ground! Halloo!</i> He carries the
sacred corn, which has been shelled, and to each household he gives
two or three grains, which are mixed with the ordinary seed-corn of
that household. After this it is lawful for the people to plant their
corn. Some of the Iñke-sabě people cannot eat red corn. This may
have some connection with the consecration of the seed-corn.

<small>INDUSTRIAL OCCUPATIONS (CONTINUED).</small></h2>

<h3 id="FOOD_AND_ITS_PREPARATION">FOOD AND ITS PREPARATION.</h3>

<p id="s164">§ 164. <i>Meat.</i>&mdash;They ate the "ʇa," or dried meat of the buffalo, elk,
deer, but seldom tasted that of the beaver. They cut the meat in slices
(wága), which they cut thin (máb¢eʞa), that it might soon dry. It was
then dried as explained in § <a href="#s150">150</a>. Before drying it is "ʇa-núʞa," wet
or fresh meat. The dried meat used to be cooked on glowing coals.
When the meat was dried in the summer it lasted for the winter's use,
but by the next summer it was all consumed. In the [T]a[p]a and Weji<sup>n</sup>cte
gentes venison and elk meat could not be eaten, and certain parts of
the buffalo could not be eaten or touched by the Iñke-sabě, Hañga,
[T]e-[p]a-it`ajĭ, [T]e-sĭnde, and Iñg¢e-jide. (See §§ <a href="#s31">31</a>, <a href="#s37">37</a>, <a href="#s49">49</a>, <a href="#s59">50</a>, and <a href="#s67">67</a>.)</p>

<p>The marrow, wajíbe, was taken from the thigh bones by means of narrow
scoops, or wébagude, which were made out of any kind of stick,
being blunt at one end. They were often thrown away after being
used.</p>

<p>The vertebræ and all the larger bones of the buffalo and other animals
are used for making wahi-weg¢i, <i>bone grease</i>, which serves as butter
and lard. In recent times hatchets have been used to crush the
bones, but formerly stone axes (i<sup>n</sup>´-igaga<sup>n</sup> or i<sup>n</sup>´-igacíje) were employed,
and some of these may still be found among the Omahas. Now the
Omahas use the i<sup>n</sup>´-wate, a large round stone, for that purpose. The
fragments of the bones are boiled, and very soon grease arises to the
surface. This is skimmed off and placed in sacks for future use. Then
the bones are thrown out and others are put in to boil. The sacks into
which the grease is put are made of the muscular coating of the stomach
of a buffalo, which has been dried, and is known as "ínijeha."</p>

<p>They ate the entrails of the buffalo and the elk. Both the small and
large intestines were boiled, then turned inside out and scraped to get
off the remains of the dung which might be adhering to them. Then
they were dried. According to Two Crows, the iñg¢e, or dung of the
buffalo, is not "b¢a<sup>n</sup>-píäjĭ," <i>offensive</i>, like that of the domestic cow.
Though the buffalo cow gives a rich milk, the Indians do not make use
of that of such as they kill in hunting.</p>

<p id="s165">§ 165. La Flèche and Two Crows never heard of any Omahas that
ate lice, but the writer saw an aged Ponka woman eat some that she
took from the head of her grandson. The following objects are not
eaten by any of the gentes: Dried fish, slugs, dried crickets, grasshoppers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
or other insects, and dried fish-spawn. Nor do they ever use
as drinks fish-oil or other oils.</p>

<p id="s166">§ 166. <i>Corn</i>, Wata<sup>n</sup>zi&mdash;La Flèche and Two Crows mention the following
varieties as found among the Omahas: 1. Wata<sup>n</sup>´zi sk&#259;, white corn,
of two sorts, one of which, wata<sup>n</sup>´zi-kúg¢i, is hard; the other, wata<sup>n</sup>´zi
sk&#259; proper, is wat'éga, or tender. 2. Wata<sup>n</sup>´zi ʇu, blue corn; one sort is
hard and translucent, the other is wat'ega. 3. Wata<sup>n</sup>´zi zi, yellow corn;
one sort is hard and translucent, the other is wat'ega. 4. Wata<sup>n</sup>´zi
g¢ejé, spotted corn; both sorts are wat'ega; one is covered with gray
spots, the other with red spots. 5. Wata<sup>n</sup>´zi ʇú-jide, a "a reddish-blue
corn." 6. Wata<sup>n</sup>´zi jíděqti, "very red corn." 7. Wata<sup>n</sup>´zi ígaxúxu, zí
kĭ jíde iháhai, ugáai éga<sup>n</sup>, <i>figured corn, on which are yellow and red
lines, as if painted</i>. 8. Wa¢ástage, of three sorts, which are the "sweet
corn" of the white people; wa¢ástage sk&#259;, which is translucent, but not
very white; wa¢astage zi, which is wat'ega and yellow, and wa¢astage
ʇu, which is wat'ega and blue. All of the above varieties mature in August.
Besides these is the Wajút`a<sup>n</sup>-kú¢ě, "that which matures soon,"
the squaw corn, which first ripens in July.</p>

<p id="s167">§ 167. <i>Modes of cooking the corn.</i>&mdash;Before corn is boiled the men call
it wata<sup>n</sup>´zi sáka, raw corn; the women call all corn that is not boiled
"sa¢áge." Wata<sup>n</sup>zi skí¢veě sweet corn, is prepared in the following ways:
When the corn is yet in the milk or soft state it is collected and boiled
on the cob. This is called "wab¢úga" or "wab¢úga ʇañga," because
the corn ear (wahába) is put whole (b¢uga) into the kettle. It is boiled
with beans alone, with dried meat alone, with beans and dried meat, or
with a buffalo paunch and beans.</p>

<p>Sometimes the sweet corn is simply roasted before it is eaten; then
it is known as "wata<sup>n</sup>´zi skí¢ě úha<sup>n</sup>-bájĭ, <i>sweet corn that is not boiled</i>."
Sometimes it is roasted on the ear with the husks on, being placed in
the hot embers, then boiled, shelled, and dried in the sun, and afterwards
packed away for keeping in <i>parflèche</i> cases. The grain prepared
in this manner has a shriveled appearance and a sweet taste, from
which the name is derived. It may be boiled for consumption at any
time of the year with but little trouble, and its taste closely resembles
that of new corn. Sometimes it is boiled, shelled, and dried without
being roasted; in this case, as in the preceding one, it is called "wata<sup>n</sup>´zi
skí¢ě uha<sup>n</sup>í, <i>boiled sweet corn</i>." This sweet corn may be boiled with
beans alone, or with beans, a buffalo paunch, pumpkins, and dried meat;
or with one or more of these articles, when all cannot be had.</p>

<p>They used to make "wa¢ískiskída, corn tied up." When the corn
was still juicy they pushed off the grains having milk in them. These
were put into a lot of husks, which were tied in a bundle, and that was
placed in a kettle to boil. Beans were often mixed with the grains of
corn before the whole was placed in the husks. In either case wa¢iskiskida
was considered very good food.</p>

<p>Dougherty said, "They also pound the sweet corn into a kind of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
small hominy, which when boiled into a thick mush, with a proper proportion
of the smaller entrails and jerked meat, is held in much estimation."
The writer never heard of this.</p>

<p>The corn which is fully ripe is sometimes gathered, shelled, dried,
and packed away for future use.</p>

<p>Hominy, wabi´ᴐnude or wanáᴐnudé¢ě, is prepared from hard corn by
boiling it in a lye of wood ashes for an hour or two, when the hard exterior
skin nearly slips off (náᴐnude). Then it is well washed to get rid
of the ashes, and rinsed, by which time the bran is rubbed off (biᴐnúde).
When needed for a meal it may be boiled alone or with one or more of
the following: Pumpkins, beans, or dried meat. Sometimes an ear of
corn is laid before the fire to roast (jé`a<sup>n</sup>he), instead of being covered
with the hot ashes.</p>

<p>Wanin´de or mush is made from the hard ripe corn by beating a few
grains at a time between two stones, making a coarse meal. The larger
stone is placed on a skin or blanket that the flying fragments may not
be lost. This meal is always boiled in water with beans, to which may
be added pumpkins, a buffalo paunch, or dried meat.</p>

<p>When they wish to make wanin´de-gáskě, or ash-cake, beans are put
on to boil, while the corn is pounded in a mortar that is stuck into the
ground. When the beans have begun to fall to pieces, but before they
are done, they are mixed with the pounded corn, and made into a large
cake, which is sometimes over two feet in diameter and four inches thick.
This cake is baked in the ashes. Occasionally corn-husks are opened
and moistened, and put over the cake before the hot ashes are put on.</p>

<p>At times the cake is made of mush alone, and baked in the ashes
with or without the corn husks.</p>

<p>₵ib¢úb¢uga, corn dumplings, are made thus: When the corn has
been pounded in a mortar, some of it is mixed with water, and beans
are added if any can be had. This is put in a kettle to boil, having
been made into round balls or dumplings, which do not fall to pieces
after boiling. The rest of the pounded corn is mixed with plenty of
water, being "nig¢uze," <i>very watery</i>, and is eaten as soup with the
dumplings.</p>

<p>Another dish is called "A<sup>n</sup>´bag¢e." When this is needed, they first
boil beans. Then, having pounded corn very fine in a mortar, they
pour the meal into the kettle with the beans. This mixture is allowed
to boil down and dry, and is not disturbed that night. The next day
when it is cold and stiff the kettle is overturned, and the a<sup>n</sup>bag¢e is
pushed out.</p>

<p>Wacañ´ge is made by parching corn, which is then pounded in a mortar;
after which the meal is mixed with grease, soup made from meat,
and pumpkins. Sometimes it is mixed, instead with honey. Then it is
made up into hard masses (¢iskíski) with the hands. Dougherty
says that with wacañge and waninde "portions of the ʇe-cibe, or smaller
intestines of the buffalo are boiled, to render the food more sapid."

<p id="s168">§ 168. <i>Melons, pumpkins, etc.</i>, Saka¢ide uke¢i<sup>n</sup>, the common watermelon,
was known to the Omahas before the coming of the white men. It has
a green rind, which is generally striped,
and the seeds are black. It is never dried,
but is always eaten raw, hence the name.
They had no yellow saka¢ide till the whites
came; but they do not eat them.</p>

<p>Waʇa<sup>n</sup>´, <i>Pumpkins</i>&mdash;The native kinds
are three: waʇa<sup>n</sup>´-qti, waʇa<sup>n</sup>´-kukúge, and
waʇa<sup>n</sup>´-múxa. Waʇa<sup>n</sup>-qti, the real pumpkins
are generally greenish, and "bícka,"
round but slightly flattened on sides like
turnips. They are usually dried, and are
called "waʇa<sup>n</sup>´-gazan´de," because they are
cut in circular slices and hung together,
as it were, in festoons (gazande).</p>

<p>The second variety is large, white, and
striped; it is not good for drying. The
waʇa<sup>n</sup>-muxa are never dried. Some are
white, others are "sábě ʇu éga<sup>n</sup>, a sort of
black or dark blue," and small. Others,
the waʇa<sup>n</sup>´-múxa g¢ejé, are spotted, and are
eaten before they become too ripe. In
former days, these were the only sweet
articles of food. Sometimes pumpkins are
baked on coals (jég¢a<sup>n</sup>).</p>

<p>Modern varieties are two: The wata<sup>n</sup>-nin´de
bazú and the wata<sup>n</sup>´-jíde. The Omahas
never plant the latter, as they do not
regard it as desirable. They plant the
former, which is from 2 to 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet long, and
covered with knots or lumps. The native
pumpkins are frequently steamed, as the kettle is filled with them cut
in slices with a very small quantity of water added. Pumpkins are
never boiled with ʇe-cibe or buffalo entrails; but they can be boiled with
a buffalo paunch, beans, dried meat, and with any preparation of corn.</p>

<p id="s169">§ 169. <i>Fruits and berries.</i>&mdash;Taspa<sup>n</sup>´, red haws, are seldom eaten; and
then are taken raw, not over two or three at a time. Clumps of the hawthorn
abound on Logan Creek, near the Omaha reserve, and furnish the
Omaha name for that stream, Taspa<sup>n</sup>´-hi báʇe.</p>

<p>Wajíde-níka, which are about the size of haws, grow on low bushes
in Northwest Nebraska. They are edible in the autumn.</p>

<p>Buffalo berries, the wajídě-qti, or real wajide, are eaten raw, or they
are dried and then boiled before eating.</p>

<p>[K]añde, plums, though dried by the Dakotas, are not dried by the
₵egiha and [T]ᴐiwere, who eat them raw.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

<p>Na<sup>n</sup>´pa, choke-cherries, are of two kinds. The larger ones or na<sup>n</sup>´pa-ʇañ´ga,
abound in a region known as [P]izábahehe, in Northwest Nebraska,
where they are very thick, as many as two hundred being found
on a single bush. Some of the bushes are a foot high, others are about
two feet in height. The choke-cherries are first pounded between two
stones, and then dried. The smaller variety, or na<sup>n</sup>´pa-jiñ´ga, grow on
tall bushes. These cherries are dried.</p>

<p>Gube, hackberries, are the size of black peppers or the smaller cherries
(na<sup>n</sup>pa-jiñga). They are fine, sweet, and black. They grow on
large trees (<i>Celtis occidentalis</i>), the bark of which is rough and inclined
to curl up.</p>

<p>Ag¢añkamañge, raspberries, are dried and boiled. Bacte, strawberries,
are not dried. They are eaten raw.</p>

<p>Ja<sup>n</sup>-qude-ju are berries that grow near the Niobrara River; they are
black and sweet, about the size of buffalo berries. They are dried.</p>

<p>Nacama<sup>n</sup> is the name of a species of berry or persimmon (?), which
ripens in the later fall. It hangs in clusters on a small stalk, which is
bent over by the weight of the fruit. The nacama<sup>n</sup> is seldom eaten by
the Omahas. It is black, not quite the size of a hazel nut; and its seed
resemble watermelon seed.</p>

<p>Hazi, grapes&mdash;one kind, the fox grape, is eaten raw, or dried and
boiled.</p>

<p id="s170">§ 170. <i>Nuts.</i>&mdash;The "búde" is like the acorn, but it grows on a different
tree, the trunk of which is red (the red oak?). These nuts are ripe
in the fall. They are boiled till the water has nearly boiled away, when
the latter is poured out, and fresh water and good ashes are put in.
Then the nuts are boiled a long time till they become black. The water
and ashes are thrown out, fresh water is put in the kettle, and the nuts
are washed till they are clean, when they are found to be "náʇube,"
cooked till ready to fall to pieces. Then they are mixed with wild honey,
and are ready for one to eat. They are "íb¢a<sup>n</sup>qtiwá¢ě," capable of
satisfying hunger to the utmost, but a handful being necessary for that
end.</p>

<p>A<sup>n</sup>´jiñga, hazel nuts, are neither boiled nor dried; they are eaten raw
The same may be said of "ʇáge," black walnuts.</p>

<p id="s171">§ 171. Fruits were preserved in wild honey alone, according to J. La
Flèche. Since the arrival of the white people a few of the Omahas
have cultivated sorghum; but in former days the only sugars and sirups
were those manufactured from the sugar maple and box elder or ash-leaved
maple.</p>

<p>The Omahas know nothing about pulse, mesquite, and screw-beans.
Nor do they use seeds of grasses and weeds for food.</p>

<p>Previous to the arrival of the whites they did not cultivate any garden
vegetables; but now many of the Omahas and Ponkas have raised
many varieties in their gardens.</p>

<p id="s172">§ 172. <i>Roots used for food.</i>&mdash;The núg¢e or Indian turnip is sometimes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
round, and at others elliptical. When the Omahas wish to dry it, they
pull off the skin. Then they cut off pieces about two inches long, and
throw away the hard interior. Then they place these pieces in a mortar
and pound them, after which they dry them. When they are dried
they are frequently mixed with grease. Occasionally they are boiled
with dried meat without being pounded. The soup is very good.</p>

<p>Nú uké¢i<sup>n</sup>, or <i>Pomme de terre</i>, the native potato, is dug in the winter
by the women. There are different kinds of this root, some of which
have good skins. Several grow on a common root, thus: <img src="images/p308_dp444.png" alt="illustration" /> These
potatoes are boiled; then the skins are pulled off, and they are dried.</p>

<p>The "si<sup>n</sup>" is an aquatic plant, resembling the water-lily. It is also
called the "si<sup>n</sup>´-uké¢i<sup>n</sup>," being the wild rice. In order to prepare it as
food it is roasted under hot ashes.</p>

<p>The other rice is the "si<sup>n</sup>´-wanin´de"; the stalk on which it grows is
the "si<sup>n</sup>´-wanin´de-hi," a species of rush which grows with rice in
swamps. The grain is translucent, and is the principal article of diet
for those Indians who reside in very cold regions north of the Ponkas.</p>

<p>Si<sup>n</sup>´-skuskúba, which some Ponkas said was the calamus, is now very
rare. Few of the Omahas know it at present. They used to eat it after
boiling it. Frank La Flèche said that this could not be calamus, as the
Omahas called that maka<sup>n</sup>-ninida, and still eat it.</p>

<p id="s173">§ 173. <i>Beans.</i>&mdash;Beans, hi<sup>n</sup>b¢iñ´ge or ha<sup>n</sup>b¢iñ´ge, are planted by the
Indians. They dry them before using them. Some are large, others
are small, being of different sizes. The Indians speak of them thus:
"búʇa-hna<sup>n</sup>i, b¢áska éga<sup>n</sup>," <i>they are generally curvilinear, and are some
what flat</i>.</p>

<p>La Flèche and Two Crows speak of many varieties, which are probably
of one and the same species: "Hi<sup>n</sup>b¢iñge sábě g¢ejé, beans that
have black spots. 2. Sk&#259; g¢ejé, those with white spots. 3. Zi´g¢ejé,
those with yellow spots. 4. Jíde g¢ejé, those with red spots. 5. Qúde
g¢ejé, those with gray spots. 6. Jíděqti, very red ones. 7. Sáběqti,
very black ones. 8. Jíde cábe éga<sup>n</sup>, those that are a sort of dark red.
9. Sk&#259;, white. 10. [T]u éga<sup>n</sup> sábě, dark blue. 11. Ji´ éga<sup>n</sup> sábě, dark
orange red. 12. Sk&#259;, ug¢e tě jide, white, with red on the "ug¢e" or
part that is united to the vine. 13. Hi-ug¢é tě sabě, those that are black
on the "ug¢e." 14. [T]u g¢eje ega<sup>n</sup>, blue, with white spots. 15. A<sup>n</sup>pa<sup>n</sup>
hi<sup>n</sup> ega<sup>n</sup>, qude zi ega<sup>n</sup>, like the hair of an elk, a sort of grayish yellow.</p>

<p>The hi<sup>n</sup>b¢i<sup>n</sup>´`abe, or hi<sup>n</sup>b¢iñge ma<sup>n</sup>tanaha, wild beans, are not planted.
They come up of their own accord. They are flat and curvilinear, and
abound under trees. The field-mice hoard them in their winter retreats,
which the Indians seek to rob. They cook them by putting them in hot
ashes.</p>

<p id="s174">§ 174. <i>[T]e¢awe</i> is the name given to the seeds and root of the <i>Nelumbium
luteum</i>, and is thus described by an Omaha: The ʇe¢awe is the
root of an aquatic plant, which is not very abundant. It has a leaf
like that of a lily, but about two feet in diameter, lying on the surface
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
of the water. The stalk comes up through the middle of the leaf, and
projects about two feet above the water. On top is a seed-pod. The
seed are elliptical, almost shaped like bullets, and they are black and
very hard. When the ice is firm or the water shallow, the Indians go
for the seed, which they parch by a fire, and beat open, then eat. They
also eat the roots. If they wish to keep them for a long time, they cut
off the roots in pieces about six inches long, and dry them; if not, they
boil them.</p>

<p id="s175">§ 175. Hi<sup>n</sup>´qa is the root of a sahi or water grass which grows beneath
the surface of Lake Nik'umi, near the Omaha Agency, Nebraska.
This root, which is about the size of the first joint of one's forefinger, is
bulbous and black. When the Omaha boys go into bathe they frequently
eat it in sport, after pulling off the skin. Two Crows says that
adults never eat it. J. La Flèche never ate it, but he has heard of it.</p>

<p id="s176">§ 176. <i>Savors, flavors, etc.</i>&mdash;Salt, ni-skí¢ě, was used before the advent
of the whites. One place known to the Omahas was on Salt River, near
Lincoln, Nebr., which city is now called by them "Ni-ski¢ě." At that
place the salt collected on top of the sand and dried. Then the Omahas
used to brush it together with feathers and take it up for use. What
was on the surface was very white, and fit for use; but that beneath
was mixed with sand and was not disturbed. Rock salt was found at
the head of a stream, southwest of the Republican, which flowed into
the northwest part of the Indian Territory, and they gave the place
the name, "Ni-skí¢ě sagí ¢a<sup>n</sup>, <i>Where the hard salt is</i>." In order to get
this salt, they broke into the mass by punching with sticks, and the detached
fragments were broken up by pounding.</p>

<p>Peppers, aromatic herbs, spices, etc., were not known in former days.
Clay was never used as food nor as a savor.</p>

<p id="s177">§ 177. <i>Drinks.</i>&mdash;The only drinks used were soups and water. Teas,
beer, wine, or other fermented juices, and distilled liquors, were unknown.
(See § <a href="#s109">109</a>.)</p>

<p id="s178">§ 178. <i>Narcotics.</i>&mdash;Native tobacco, or niní. The plant, niní-hi was the
only narcotic known previous to the coming of our race. It differs from
the common tobacco plant; none of it has been planted in modern times.
J. La Flèche saw some of it when he was small. Its leaves were "ʇúqude
éga<sup>n</sup>," a sort of a blue color, and were about the size of a man's
hand, and shaped somewhat like a tobacco leaf. Mr. H. W. Henshaw,
of the United States Geological Survey, has been making some investigations
concerning the narcotics used by many of the Indian tribes. He
finds that the Rees and other tribes did have a native tobacco, and that
some of it is still cultivated. This strengthens the probability that the
niní of the Omahas and Ponkas was a native plant.</p>

<p>Mixed tobacco or killickinnick is called ninígahi by the Omahas and
Ponkas. This name implies that native or common, tobacco (niní) has
been mixed (igahi) with some other ingredient. "This latter is generally
the inner bark of the red willow (<i>Cornus sericea</i>), and occasionally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
it is composed of sumac leaves (<i>Rhus glabrum</i>). When neither of these
can be had the inner bark of the arrow wood (<i>Viburnum</i>) or ma<sup>n</sup>´sa-hi
is substituted for them. The two ingredients are well dried over a fire,
and rubbed together between the hands." (Dougherty, in <i>Long's Expedition</i>,
I.)</p>

<p>"In making ninígahi, the inner bark of the dogwood, to which are
sometimes added sumac leaves, is mixed with the tobacco. Sometimes
they add wajide-hi ha, the inner bark of rose-bushes. When they cannot
get dogwood or sumac they may use the bark of the ma<sup>n</sup>śa hi or arrow-wood.
The bark of the ¢ixe sagi, or hard willow, is not used by the
Omahas." (Frank La Flèche.)</p>

<h3 id="CLOTHING_AND_ITS_PREPARATION">CLOTHING AND ITS PREPARATION.</h3>

<p id="s179">§ 179. Garments were usually made by the women, while men made
their weapons. Some of the Omahas have adopted the clothing of the
white man. There is no distinction between the attire of dignitaries
and that of the common people.</p>

<p id="s180">§ 180. There were no out-buildings, public granaries, etc. Each household
stored away its own grain and other provisions. There were no
special tribal or communal dwellings, but sometimes two or more families
occupied one earth lodge. When a tribal council was held, it was
in the earth lodge of one of the principal chiefs, or else two or three
common tents were thrown into one, making a long tent.</p>

<p>There were no public baths, as the Missouri River was near, and they
could resort to it when they desired. Dances were held in earth lodges,
or else in large skin tents, when not out of doors.</p>

<p id="s181">§ 181. <i>Dressing hides.</i>&mdash;The hides were stretched and dried as soon as
possible after they were taken from the animals. When a hide was
stretched on the ground, pins were driven through holes along the border
of the hide. These holes had been cut with a knife. While the
hide was still green, the woman scraped it on the under side by pushing
a wébajábe over its surface, thus removing the superfluous flesh,
etc. The wébajábe was formed from the lower bone of an elk's leg,
which had been made thin by scraping or striking ("gab¢eʞa"). The
lower end was sharpened
by striking, having several
teeth-like projections, as in
the accompanying figure
(B). A withe (A) was tied
to the upper end, and this
was secured to the arm of
the woman just above the wrist.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>&mdash;The Webajabe.</p>
</div>

<p>When the hide was dry the woman stretched it again on the ground,
and proceeded to make it thinner and lighter by using another implement,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
called the wéubája<sup>n</sup>, which she moved towards her after the manner
of an adze. This instrument was formed from an elk horn, to the
lower end of which was fastened a piece of iron (in recent times)
called the wé`u-hi.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>When the hide was needed for a summer tent, leggings, or summer
clothing of any sort, the wéubája<sup>n</sup> was applied to the hairy side.
When the hide was sufficiently smooth, grease was rubbed on it, and it
was laid out of doors to dry in the sun. This act of greasing the hide
was called "wawé¢iq¢i," because they sometimes used the brains of the
elk or buffalo for that purpose. Brains, wé¢iq¢i, seem to have their name
from this custom, or else from the primitive verb ¢iq¢i. Dougherty
stated that, in his day, they used to spread over the hide the brains or
liver of the animal, which had been carefully retained for that purpose,
and the warm broth of the meat was also poured over it. Some persons
made two-thirds of the brain of an animal suffice for dressing its skin.
But Frank La Flèche says that the liver was not used for tanning purposes,
though the broth was so used when it was brackish.</p>

<p>When the hide had been dried in the sun, it was soaked by sinking it
beneath the surface of any adjacent stream. This act lasted about two
days. Then the hide was dried again and subjected to the final operation,
which was intended to make it sufficiently soft and pliant. A
twisted sinew, about as thick as one's finger, called the wé¢ikĭnde, was
fastened at each end to a post or tree, about 5 feet from the ground.
The hide was put through this, and pulled back and forth. This act
was called wa¢íkĭnde.</p>

<p>On the commencement of this process, called ta<sup>n</sup>´¢ě, the hides were
almost invariably divided longitudinally into two parts each, for the
convenience of the operator. When they were finished they were again
sewed together with awls and sinew. When the hides were small they
were not so divided before they were tanned. The skins of elk, deer,
and antelopes were dressed in a similar manner.

<h3 id="WAR_CUSTOMS">WAR CUSTOMS.</h3>

<p id="s182">§ 182. The Indians say that Ictinike was he who taught their ancestors
all their war customs, such as blackening the face. (See myth of
Ictinike and the Deserted Children in Contributions to N. A. Ethnology,
Vol. VI, Part I.)</p>

<p><i>Origin of wars.</i>&mdash;Wars generally originated in the stealing of horses
and the elopement of women, and sometimes they are in consequence of
infringing on the hunting-grounds of one another. When a party of
warriors go on the war-path they do not always go after scalps only;
the object of the expedition may be to steal horses from the enemy. If
they can get the horses without being detected they may depart without
killing any one. But should they meet any of the people they do not
hesitate to attempt their lives. If the followers or servants fail to bring
away the horses it is the duty of the leaders to make an attempt.</p>

<p id="s183">§ 183. <i>Mode of fighting unlike that of nations of the Old World.</i>&mdash;War
was not carried on by these tribes as it is by the nations of the Old World.
The ₵egiha and other tribes have no standing armies. Unlike the Six
Nations, they have no general who holds his office for life, or for a given
term. They have no militia, ready to be called into the field by the
government. On the contrary, military service is voluntary in all cases,
from the private to the commanders, and the war party is usually disbanded
as soon as home is reached. They had no wars of long duration;
in fact, wars between one Indian tribe and another scarcely ever
occurred; but there were occasional battles, perhaps one or two in the
course of a season.</p>

<h4 id="DEFENSIVE_WARFARE">DEFENSIVE WARFARE.</h4>

<p id="s184">§ 184. When the foe had made an attack on the Omahas (or Ponkas)
and had killed some of the people it was the duty of the surviving men
to pursue the offenders and try to punish them. This going in pursuit
of the foe, called níka-¢íqě ¢é, was undertaken immediately without
any of the ceremonies connected with a formal departure on the war-path,
which was offensive warfare. When the Ponkas rushed to meet
the Brulé and Ogala Dakotas, June 17, 1872, Húta<sup>n</sup>-gi´hna<sup>n</sup>, a woman,
ran with them most of the way, brandishing a knife and singing songs
to incite the men to action. The women did not always behave thus.
They generally dug pits as quickly as possible and crouched in them
in order to escape the missiles of the combatants. And after the fight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
they used to seek for the fallen enemy in order to mutilate them.
When some of the upper Dakotas had taken a prisoner they secured
him to a stake and allowed their women to torture him by mutilating
him previous to killing him, <i>etiam genitalia exciderunt</i>. But the writer
never heard of the ₵egiha women's having acted in this manner.</p>

<p id="s185">§ 185. <i>Preparation for the attack by the foe.</i>&mdash;About thirty-two years
ago the Dakotas and Ponkas attacked the Omahas, but the latter had
timely notice of their intentions and prepared for them. Four Omahas
had found the camp of the enemy and reported to their friends that the
foe would make the attack either that night or the next morning. So
the Omahas made ready that night, having sent a crier around the tribal
circle, saying, "They say that you must make an intrenchment for the
children. The foe will surely come!" Then the people made an embankment
around the greater part of the circle. It was about 4 feet high,
and on the top were planted all the tent poles, the tents having been
pulled down. The tent poles were interlaced and over these were fastened
all the tent skins as far as they would go. This was designed as
a screen for the men, while for the women and children was dug a trench
about 4 or 5 feet deep, inside the embankment.</p>

<p>Mr. J. La Flèche, who was present during the fight, says that the embankment
did not extend all around the circle, and that the area previously
occupied by the tents of the end gentes, Weji<sup>n</sup>cte, Ictasanda,
etc., were not thus protected, and that he and others slept on the ground
that night. Some of the men dug trenches for the protection of their
horses. Early in the morning the crier went around, saying, "They say
that you must do your best, as day is at hand. They have come!" The
night scouts came in and reported having heard the sounds made by the
tramping of the host of the advancing foe. Then the crier exhorted the
people again, "They say that you must do your best! You have none to
help you. You will lie with your weapons in readiness. You will load your
guns. They have come!" Some of the Omahas fought outside of the
embankment, others availed themselves of that shelter, and cut holes
through the skins so that they might aim through them at the enemy.
These structures for defense were made by digging up the earth with
sticks which they had sharpened with axes. The earth thrown up made
the embankment for the men, and the hollows or trenches were the
u¢íhnucka into which the women and children retreated.</p>

<p id="s186">§ 186. <i>Old Ponka Fort.</i>&mdash;At the old Ponka Agency, in what was Todd
County, Dakota Territory, may be seen the remains of an ancient fort,
which the Ponkas say was erected over a hundred years ago by their
forefathers. J. La Flèche saw it many years ago, and he says that the
curvilinear intrenchment used to be higher than a man; <i>i. e.</i>, over six
feet high. Many earth-lodges used to be inside. At the time it was
built the Yanktons were in Minnesota, and the tribes who fought the
Ponkas were the Rees, Cheyennes, and Pádañka (Camanches). Then
the only Dakotas out of Minnesota were the Oglala and the Sitca<sup>n</sup>xu
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
or Brulés. The former were on the White River and in the region
of the Black Hills. The latter were in Nebraska, at the head of the
Platte.</p>

<p>The fort had but one entrance. The situation was well chosen. The
embankment occupied the greater part of a semi detached bluff. In
front, and at one side, was the low bench of land next to the Missouri;
at the rear was a ravine which separated it from the next bluff, and
the only means of approach was by one side, next the head of the ravine.
Then one had to pass along the edge of the ravine for over 200 yards in
order to reach the entrance. The following sketch was drawn from
memory, and Mr. La Flèche pronounced it substantially correct:</p>

<h4 id="OFFENSIVE_WARFARE">OFFENSIVE WARFARE.</h4>

<p id="s187">§ 187. The first proposition to go on the war-path cannot come
from the chiefs, who, by virtue of their office, are bound to use all
their influence in favor of peace, except under circumstances of extraordinary
provocation. It is generally a young man who decides to
undertake an expedition against the enemy. Having formed his plan,
he speaks thus to his friend: "My friend, as I wish to go on the war-path,
let us go. Let us boil the food for a feast." The friend having
consented, the two are the leaders or nuda<sup>n</sup>´hañga, if they can induce
others to follow them. So they find two young men whom they
send as messengers to invite those whom they name. Each wág¢a or
messenger takes one half of the gentile circle (if the tribe is thus encamped),
and goes quietly to the tent of each one whom he has been requested
to invite. He says at the entrance, without going in, "Kagéha,
¢íkui h&#259;, ca<sup>n</sup>´¢iñkéi<sup>n</sup>te."&mdash;<i>My friend, you are invited</i> (by such and such a
one), <i>after he has been occupied awhile</i>. If the man is there, his wife
replies to the messenger, "₵ikáge na`a<sup>n´</sup> hě," <i>Your friend hears it</i>.
Should the man be absent, the wife must reply, "₵ikáge ¢iñgéě hě;
cuhí taté."&mdash;<i>Your friend is not (here); he shall go to you.</i> These invitations
are made at night, and as quietly as possible, lest others should
hear of the feast and wish to join the expedition; this, of course,
refers to the organization of a nuda<sup>n</sup>-jiñga or small war-party, which
varies in number from two persons to about ten.</p>

<p id="s188">§ 188. <i>Small war party.</i>&mdash;After the return of the messengers, the
guests assemble at the lodge or tent of their host. The places of the
guests, messengers, and nuda<sup>n</sup>hañga
are shown in the diagram.</p>

<div class="figright w50">

wag¢a, or messengers; C, the guests; D, the food in kettles over the fire.</p>
</div>

<p>The two wéku or hosts sit opposite
the entrance, while the messengers
have their seats next the door,
so that they may pass in and out
and attend to the fire, bringing in
wood and water, and also wait on
the guests. Each guest brings with
him his bowl and spoon.</p>

<p>When all have assembled the
planner of the expedition addresses
the company. "Ho! my friends,
my friend and I have invited you
to a feast, because we wish to go on
the war-path." Then the young men
say: "Friend, in what direction
shall we go"? The host replies, "We desire to go to the place whither
they have taken our horses."</p>

<p>Then each one who is willing to go, replies thus: "Yes, my friend, I
am willing." But he who is unwilling replies, "My friend, I do not wish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
to go. I am unwilling." Sometimes the host says, "Let us go by such
a day. Prepare yourselves."</p>

<p>The food generally consists of dried meat and corn. [P]á¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pájĭ
said that he boiled fresh venison.</p>

<p>According to [P]á¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pájĭ, the host sat singing sacred songs, while
the leaders of those who were not going with the party sat singing
dancing songs. Four times was the song passed around, and they used
to dance four times. When the singing was concluded all ate, including
the giver of the feast. This is denied by La Flèche and Two Crows.
(See § <a href="#s196">196</a>.)</p>

<p>A round bundle of grass is placed on each side of the stick on which
the kettle is hung. The bundles are intended for wiping the mouths
and hands of the men after they have finished eating. At the proper
time, each messenger takes up a bundle of the grass and hands it to
the nuda<sup>n</sup>hañga on his side of the fire-place. When the nuda<sup>n</sup>hañga
have wiped their faces and hands they hand the bundles to their next
neighbors, and from these two they are passed in succession around to
the door. Then the bundles are put together, and handed again to one
of the nuda<sup>n</sup>hañga, for the purpose of wiping his bowl and spoon, passing
from him and his associate to the men on the left of the fire-place,
thence by the entrance to those on the right of the fire-place to the
nuda<sup>n</sup>hañga. Then the messengers receive the bundle, and use it for
wiping out the kettle or kettles. Then the host says, "Now! enough!
Take ye it." Then the wag¢a put the grass in the fire, making a great
smoke. Whereupon the host and his associate exclaim, "Hold your
bowls over the smoke." All arise to their feet, and thrust their bowls
into the smoke. Each one tries to anticipate the rest, so the bowls are
knocked against one another, making a great noise. This confusion is
increased by each man crying out for himself, addressing the Wakanda,
or deity of the thunder, who is supposed by some to be the god of war.
One says, "Núda<sup>n</sup>hañgá, wi<sup>n</sup>´ t'éa¢ě támiñke."&mdash;<i>O war-chief! I will kill
one.</i> Another, "Núda<sup>n</sup>hañgá, cañ´ge wáb¢ize ag¢í."&mdash;<i>O war-chief! I
have come back with horses which I have taken.</i> (This and the following
are really prayers for the accomplishment of the acts mentioned.)
Another: "Núda<sup>n</sup>hañgá, [p]á wi<sup>n</sup> b¢íqa<sup>n</sup>."&mdash;<i>O war-chief! I have pulled a
head, and broken it off.</i> Another, "Núda<sup>n</sup>hañgá, ásku u¢íza<sup>n</sup>qti wi<sup>n</sup>
b¢íze h&#259;."&mdash;<i>O war-chief! I, myself, have taken one by the very middle of
his scalp-lock.</i> Another, "Ú ¢iñgě´qti, núda<sup>n</sup>hañgá, wi<sup>n</sup>´ ub¢a<sup>n</sup>´."&mdash;<i>O
war chief! I have taken hold of one who did not receive a wound.</i> And
another, "Ábag¢aqti éde ub¢a<sup>n</sup>´ h&#259;."&mdash;<i>He drew back as he was very
doubtful of success</i> (in injuring me?), <i>but I</i> (advanced and) <i>took hold of
him</i>. Those sitting around and gazing at the speakers are laughing.
These lookers on are such as have refused to join the party. Then
the guests pass in regular order around the circle, following the course
of the sun, and passing before the host as they file out at the entrance.
Each one has to go all around before he leaves the lodge.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></p>

<p id="s189">§ 189. This feasting is generally continued four days (or nights); but
if the occasion be an urgent one the men make hasty preparations, and
may depart in less than four days. Each nuda<sup>n</sup>hañgá boils the food for
one night's feast; and what he prepares must differ from what is boiled
by the other. Sometimes two leaders boil together on the same day;
sometimes they take separate days, and sometimes when they boil on
separate days they observe no fixed order, <i>i. e.</i>, the first leader may
boil for two days in succession, then the second for one or two, or the
second leader may begin and the first follow on the next day, and so on.
When the supply of food fails the host may tell some of the wagáq¢a<sup>n</sup>
or servants (who may be the messengers) to go after game.</p>

<p id="s190">§ 190. <i>Preparation for starting.</i>&mdash;Each warrior makes up a bundle composed
of about fifteen pairs of moccasins, with sinew, an awl, and a sack
of provisions, consisting of corn which has been parched. The latter is
sometimes pounded and mixed with fat and salt. This is prepared by
the women several days in advance of the time for departure. If the warriors
leave in haste, not having time to wait for the sewing of the moccasins,
the latter are merely cut out by the women. [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ said that
nearly all of the party had some object which was sacred, which they
carried either in the belt or over one shoulder and under the opposite
arm. La Flèche and Two Crows deny this, but they tell of such medicine
in connection with the [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-wasabe society. (See Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_X">X</a>.)</p>

<p id="s191">§ 191. <i>Secret departure.</i>&mdash;The departure takes place at night. Each
man tries to slip off in the darkness by himself, without being suspected
by any one. The leaders do not wish many to follow lest they
should prove disobedient and cause the enemy to detect their proximity.</p>

<p>Another reason for keeping the proposed expedition a secret from all
but the guests is the fear least the chiefs should hear of it. The chiefs
frequently oppose such undertakings, and try to keep the young men
from the war-path. If they learn of the war feast they send a man to
find out whither the party intends going. Then the leaders are invited
to meet the chiefs. On their arrival they find presents have been put
in the middle of the lodge to induce them to abandon their expedition.
(See Two Crows' war story, in Contributions to North American Ethnology,
Vol. VI, Part I.)</p>

<p>The next day the people in the village say, "Ha<sup>n</sup>´adi nuda<sup>n</sup>´ a¢a´-bikeamá."&mdash;<i>It
is said that last night they went off in a line on the war-path.</i></p>

<p>The warriors and the leaders blacken their faces with charcoal and
rub mud over them. They wear buffalo robes with the hair out, if they
can get them, and over them they rub white clay. The messengers or
wag¢a also wear plumes in their hair and gird themselves with macaka<sup>n</sup>,
or women's pack-straps. All must fast for four days. When they have
been absent for that period they stop fasting and wash their faces.</p>

<p id="s192">§ 192. <i>Uninvited followers.</i>&mdash;When a man notices others with weapons,
and detects other signs of warlike preparation, should he wish to join
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
the party he begs moccasins, etc., from his kindred. When he is ready
he goes directly after the party. The following day, when the warriors
take their seats, the follower sits in sight of them, but at some distance.
When one of the servants spies him he says to his captain, "Núda<sup>n</sup>hañgá,
¢éʇa aká wi<sup>n</sup>´ atíi h&#259;."&mdash;<i>O war chief! this one in the rear has come.</i>
Then the captain says to all the warriors, "Hau, níkawasa<sup>n</sup>´, íbaha<sup>n</sup>ba
hi<sup>n</sup>bé ctĭ ¢awái-g&#259;. Ma<sup>n</sup>´ tě ctĭ wégaska<sup>n</sup>¢ái-gà."&mdash;<i>Ho, warriors! recognise
him, if you can, and count your moccasins</i> (to see if you can spare
him any). <i>Examine your arrows, too.</i> Then a servant is sent to see
who the follower is. On his return he says, "War-chief (<i>or</i> captain), it
is he," naming the man. The captain has no set reply; sometimes he
says, "Ho, warriors! the man is active. Go after him. He can aid us
by killing game." Or he may say, "Hau, nikawasa<sup>n</sup>´! ní é¢i¢i<sup>n</sup> gí tě
a¢i<sup>n</sup>´ gíi-g&#259;. Águdi ca<sup>n</sup>´ʇañga náxi¢í¢í¢ě ʞĭ, gaha a¢ija<sup>n</sup> ga<sup>n</sup>´¢ai ʞĭ, ca<sup>n</sup>´
éja<sup>n</sup>-mi<sup>n</sup>´ h&#259;."&mdash;<i>Ho, warriors! go for him that he may bring water for you.
If he wishes to lie on you</i> (<i>i. e.</i>, on your bodies) <i>when the big wolves (</i>or the
foe) <i>attack you, I think it is proper.</i> Then the scout goes after the follower.</p>

<p>But if the man be lazy, fond of sleeping, etc., and the scout reports
who he is, they do not receive him. Once there was a man who persisted
in going with war parties though he always caused misfortunes.
The last time he followed a party the captains refused to receive him.
Then he prayed to Wakanda to bring trouble on the whole party for
their treatment of him. They were so much alarmed that they abandoned
the expedition.</p>

<p id="s193">§ 193. <i>Officers.</i>&mdash;A small war party has for its chief officers two nuda<sup>n</sup>hañga,
<i>partisans</i>, captains, or war chiefs. Each nuda<sup>n</sup>hañga has his
nuda<sup>n</sup>´hañga-q¢éxe or lieutenant, through whom he issues his orders
to the men. These lieutenants or adjutants are always chosen before
the party leaves the village. After the food has been boiled the giver
of the feast selects two brave young men, to each of whom he says,
"Nuda<sup>n</sup>´hañga-q¢éxe hni<sup>n</sup>´ taté," <i>You shall be a nuda<sup>n</sup>hañga-q¢éxe.</i></p>

<p>In 1854 Two Crows was invited by four others to aid them in organizing
a large war party. But as they went to the feast given by the
chiefs and received the presents they forfeited their right to be captains.
Two Crows refused the gifts, and persisted in his design, winning
the position of first captain. Wanace-jiñga was the other, and
[P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ and Sĭnde-xa<sup>n</sup>xa<sup>n</sup> were the lieutenants. In this case a
large party was intended, but it ended in the formation of a small one.
For the change from a small party to a large one see § <a href="#s210">210</a>.</p>

<p id="s194">§ 194. <i>Large war party.</i>&mdash;A large war party is called "Nuda<sup>n</sup>´hi<sup>n</sup>-ʇañ´ga."
La Flèche and Two Crows do not remember one that has
occurred among the Omahas. The grandfather of Two Crows joined
one against the Panis about a hundred years ago. And Two Crows was
called on to assist in organizing one in 1854, when fifty men were collected
for an expedition which was prevented by the chiefs. Such parties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
usually number one or two hundred men, and sometimes all the
fighting men in the tribe volunteer. Occasionally the whole tribe moves
against an enemy, taking the women, children, etc., till they reach the
neighborhood of the foe, when the non-combatants are left at a safe distance,
and the warriors go on without them. This moving with the
whole camp is called "áwaha<sup>n</sup>qti ¢é," or "ágaq¢a<sup>n</sup>qti ¢é", because they
go in a body, as they do when traveling on the buffalo hunt.</p>

<p id="s195">§ 195. When a large war party is desired the man who plans the
expedition selects his associates, and besides these there must be at least
two more nuda<sup>n</sup>hañga; but only the planner and his friend are the
nuda<sup>n</sup>hañga úju, or principal war chiefs. Sometimes, as in the case
of Wabaskaha (Contributions to N. A. Ethnology, Vol. VI, Part I, p.
394), the man paints his face with clay or mud, and wanders around,
crying to Wakanda thus: "O Wakanda! though the foreigners have
injured me, I hope that you may help me!" The people hear him, and
know by his crying that he desires to lead a war party; so they go to
him to hear his story.</p>

<p>Four wag¢a are sent to invite the guests, two taking each side of the
tribal circle, and hallooing as they pass each tent. There is no cause
for secrecy on such occasions, so the crier calls out the name of each
guest, and bids him bring his bowl. In the case of Wabaskaha, so
great was the wrong suffered that all the men assembled, including the
chiefs. This was the day after Wabaskaha had told his story. Then a
pipe (the war pipe) was filled. Wabaskaha extended his hands toward
the people, and touched them on their heads saying, "Pity me; do for
me as you think best." Then the chief who filled the sacred pipe said
to the assembly, "If you are willing for us to take vengeance on the
Pawnees, put that pipe to your lips; if (any of) you are unwilling, do
not put it to your lips." Then every man put the pipe to his lips and
smoked it. And the chief said, "Come! Make a final decision. Decide
when we shall take vengeance on them." And one said, "O leader!
during the summer let us eat our food, and pray to Wakanda. In the
early fall let us take vengeance on them." The four captains were constantly
crying by day and night, saying, "O Wakanda! pity me. Help
me in that about which I am in a bad humor." They were crying even
while they accompanied the people on the summer hunt. During the
day they abstained from food and drink; but at night they used to
partake of food and drink water.</p>

<p id="s196">§ 196. <i>Feast.</i>&mdash;It was customary for the guests invited to join a large
war party to go to the lodge designated, where four captains sat opposite
the entrance, and two messengers sat on each side of the door. The
ensuing ceremonies were substantially those given in § <a href="#s188">188</a>, with the
exception of the use of the wa¢íxabe or sacred bags, which are never
used except when large war parties are organized.</p>

<p><i>Sacred bags.</i>&mdash;These sacred bags, which are consecrated to the thunder
or war god, are so called because when the Indians went on the war-path
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
they used to ¢ixábe or strip off the feathers of red, blue, and yellow
birds, and put them into the sacred bags. There were five bags of
this sort among the Omahas. The principal one is kept by Wacka<sup>n</sup>´-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>,
of the Wajiñga-¢atájĭ subgens of the ₵átada. It is filled with
the feathers and skins of small birds, and is wrapped in a ʇahúpezi, or
worn tent-skin. This is the principal one. The second one is kept by
the daughter of [T]ahé-jiñga, of the Iñké-sabě; because the people pity
her, they allow her to keep the bag which her father used to have; but
they do not allow her to take any part in the ceremonies in which the
sacred bags are used. The third bag is in the custody of Máhi<sup>n</sup> ¢iñ´ge
of the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte gens. The fourth, when in existence, was kept by [T]idé-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>,
of the [T]a-[p]a gens. And the fifth was made by Wábaskaha, of
the Iñg¢e´-jide gens. This, too, is no longer in existence. According to
La Flèche and Two Crows, the only wa¢ixabe used in war are made of
the (skin and feathers of the) g¢eda<sup>n</sup>´, or pigeon-hawk, the i<sup>n</sup>´be-jañ´ka,
or forked-tail hawk, and the nickúcku, or martin. All three kinds
were not carried by the same war party. Sometimes one man carries
an i<sup>n</sup>be-jañka, and the other a nickucku; at other times one carries a
g¢eda<sup>n</sup>, and the other an i<sup>n</sup>be-jañka or nickucku. [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ says
that the weasel is very sacred. Two Crows never heard this; and he
says that the keeper of any very sacred object never reveals what it is.
These sacred bags are not heavy; yet the bearer of one has no other
work. He must wear his robe tied at the neck, and drawn around him
even in warm weather.</p>

<p>At the feast, the three wa¢ixabe are put in the middle of the lodge.
The keepers take their seats, and sing sacred songs, some of which are
addresses to the Thunder, while others are dancing songs. Among the
former is one of which a fragment was given by [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wi-ʇi´-ga<sup>n</sup> na<sup>n</sup>´-pe-wa´-¢ě e-ga<sup>n</sup>´,</span>
<span class="i0">Wi-ʇi´-ga<sup>n</sup> na<sup>n</sup>´-pe-wa´-¢ě e-ga<sup>n</sup>´,</span>
<span class="i0">We´-ti<sup>n</sup> kě g¢i´-ha<sup>n</sup>-ha<sup>n</sup> ʞĭ,</span>
<span class="i0">Na<sup>n</sup>´-pe wá-¢ě&mdash;&mdash;."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As my grandfather is dangerous,</span>
<span class="i0">As my grandfather is dangerous,</span>
<span class="i0">When he brandishes his club,</span>
<span class="i0">Dangerous&mdash;&mdash;."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>When he had proceeded so far [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ stopped and refused to
tell the rest, as it was too sacred.</p>

<p>This song is also sung by the keepers of the wa¢ixabe after the return
of the warriors, when the ordeal of the wastégistú is tried. (See § <a href="#s214">214</a>.)</p>

<p>Though the keepers sometimes sing the songs four times, and the
others then dance around four times, this is not always done so often.
After the dance they enjoy the feast.</p>

<p>Presents are made by the giver of the feast to the keepers of the
wa¢ixabe, who are thus persuaded to lend their sacred bags with the
peculiar advantages or sacredness which they claim for them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span></p>

<p id="s197">§ 197. The principal captains select the lieutenants, and assign to
each of the other captains a company of about twenty warriors. Each
of the minor captains camps with his own company, which has its own
camp-fire apart from the other companies. But only the two principal
captains select the scouts, police, etc.</p>

<p>When the fasting, etc., begins (see § <a href="#s191">191</a>), even the captains wear
plumes in their hair.</p>

<p>When the party is very large, requiring many moccasins, and they
intend going a long distance, a longer period than four days may be required
for their preparations.</p>

<p>According to [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ, the principal captains tie pieces of twisted
grass around their wrists and ankles, and wear other pieces around
their heads. This refers to the Thunder god. Two Crows says that he
never did this.</p>

<p id="s198">§ 198. <i>Opening of the bags.</i>&mdash;When the principal captains wish to open
their sacred bags, they assemble their followers in a circle, making them
sit down. Any of the followers or servants (the terms are interchangeable)
may be ordered to make an "ujéʇi" in the center of the circle, by
pulling up the grass, then making a hole in the ground. Then the sacred
bags are laid at the feet of the principal captains, each one of whom
opens his own bag, holding the mouth of the bird towards the foe, even
when some of the warriors are going to steal horses.</p>

<p id="s199">§ 199. <i>Policemen or Wanáce.</i>&mdash;These are selected after the party has
left the village, sometimes during the next day or night, sometimes on
the second day. The appointments are made by the principle captains.
If the war-party be a small one, few policemen (from seven to ten) are
appointed; but if it is a large party, many are appointed, perhaps
twenty. There is never any fixed number; but circumstances always
determine how many are required. For a small party, two wanáce-nuda<sup>n</sup>´hañga,
or captains of police, are appointed, to whom the principal
captains say, "Wanáce ¢anúda<sup>n</sup>hañ´ga taté," <i>You shall be captains
of the police</i>. Each of these wanáce-nuda<sup>n</sup>´hañga has several
wanáce at his command. When any of the warriors are disobedient,
or are disposed to lag behind the rest, the policemen hit them at the
command of their own captains, the wanáce-nuda<sup>n</sup>´hañga. When the
wanáce see that the men are straggling, they cry, "Wa<sup>n</sup>&lt;! wa<sup>n</sup>&lt;!" On
hearing this, the warriors say, "The policemen are calling"; so they
run towards the main body.</p>

<p id="s200">§ 200. <i>Order of march for any war party.</i>&mdash;The scouts, or wada<sup>n</sup>´be-ma,
go from two to four miles in advance during the day. There are only
two of these when the party is a small one; but a large party has four.
These scouts are sent ahead as soon as they have eaten their breakfasts.
They do not always go straight ahead. Should they come to a hill, they
do not ascend, preferring to make a detour by going along a "skída,"
or high level forming an opening between two hills. If, when they reach
there, they detect no signs of a foe, they continue on their way. Some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
of the warriors may go out as scouts of their own accord, before requested
to do so by the captains.</p>

<p id="s201">§ 201. When there is a large party, the two nuda<sup>n</sup>´hañga-jiñ´ga, or
minor captains, bearing the sacred bags, go about a hundred yards in
advance of the others. Then march the captains, and after them follow
the warriors and those who are the servants of the captains. Each
captain has his servant, who carries his captain's baggage and rations,
waits on him, brings him food and water, and makes his couch when
they camp for the night. As the day advances and the warriors become
tired, they drop behind. Then the captains order those near them
to halt and sit down. If there are bearers of the wa¢ixabe, they are
the first to take their seats at the command of the captains, who sit
next to them. Then the nearest warriors are seated, and so on, as they
come together. Those in the rear sit where they please. It is important
for the party to keep together, for they might be exterminated if attacked
when the men are scattered. As soon as those in the rear have
overtaken the rest, all arise and resume the march.</p>

<p>The scouts having gone to the place designated, return to report, and
two of the captains go ahead to meet them. Having reported whether
they have seen traces of an enemy or of game, etc., they are relieved,
and others are sent ahead in their places. This change of day scouts
takes place as many times as the circumstances require. One of the
men who bears the kettle on his back, acts as if he were a captain, addressing
the warriors thus: "Ho, warriors! bring me water," or, "Ho,
warriors! bring me some wood."</p>

<p id="s202">§ 202. <i>Songs.</i>&mdash;Sometimes when a man thinks that he will die fighting
the enemy he sings different songs. One of these songs given by [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ,
was intended to infuriate the warriors. He said that it was the
"Captive song," and was not regarded as sacred. Though he said that
it was sung by one of the wanáce-nuda<sup>n</sup>hañga, as he danced around the
marching warriors, that is doubted by La Flèche and Two Crows, who
said that one of the nuda<sup>n</sup>hañga was not always singing and dancing
around the others. The song, as sung, differs from the spoken words.</p>

<p>One of the sacred songs which follows is from the [T]ᴐiwere language,
and was sung by an Omaha captain. It is given, as sung in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
Omaha notation of the [T]ᴐiwere. The meaning of all the words cannot

</div></div>
</div>

<p>After singing this the captain addressed the men thus: "Ho, warriors!
I have truly said that I shall have my heart's desire! Truly,
warriors, they shall not detect me at all. I am now proceeding without
any desire to save life. If I meet one of the foe I will not spare him."</p>

<p id="s203">§ 203. The Míʞasi watcí or <i>Coyote Dance</i>.&mdash;This was danced by the
warriors before they retired for the night, to keep up their spirits. It
was not danced every night, but only when thought necessary. The
captains took no part in it. Some sang the dancing songs. All whitened
themselves (sa<sup>n</sup>ki¢a¢a). Each one carried a gourd rattle and a bow; he
wore his quiver in his belt, and had his robe around him. They imitated
the actions of the coyote, trotting, glancing around, etc.</p>

<p id="s204">§ 204. <i>Order of encamping.</i>&mdash;As soon as they stop to camp for the night
four night scouts are sent out, one in advance, towards the country of
the foe, one to the rear, and one on each side of the camp, each
scout going for about a mile. Before they depart the captains say, "Ho,
warriors! When you feel sleepy come back," referring to midnight.
Then the scouts leave, and as soon as they reach their respective stations
they lie down and watch for any signs of the enemy.</p>

<p>At the command of the nuda<sup>n</sup>hañga-q¢exe the camp is formed in a
circle, with the fire in the center. The warriors are told to go for wood
and water, and the servants of the captains prepare couches for their respective
masters by pulling grass, some of which they twist and tie up
for pillows. Each servant does this for his own captain. When bad
weather is threatening the lieutenants order the warriors to build a
grass lodge. For tent poles they cut many long saplings of hard willow
or of any other kind of wood, and stick them in the ground at acute angles,
and about one foot apart, if wood is plentiful, and small sticks are interlaced.
Then they cover this frame with grass. When wood is very
scarce the saplings are placed further apart.</p>

<p>Unlike the Iowas, the Omahas do not open their sacred bags when
they encamp for the night. All the bags are hung on two or three
forked sticks, the wa¢íxabe-u¢úbaʇig¢e, which are about three feet high.
These sticks are placed about five feet from the circle of warriors, close
enough to be seized at once in case of an attack.</p>

<p>Should any scout detect danger he must give the cry of a coyote
or míʞasi. By and by, when the scouts become sleepy, and there is no
sign of danger, they return to the camp, and lie down with their comrades
till nearly day. When it is time for roosters to crow, one of the
captains exclaims, "Ho, warriors! rise ye and kindle a fire." Then all
arise and dress in haste, and after they have eaten, the scouts are sent
ahead, as on the preceding morning.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span></p>

<p id="s205">§ 205. <i>New names taken.</i>&mdash;When the warriors have been four nights
on the way, excluding the night of departure from the village, the warriors
generally take new names. But if any one likes his old name he
can retain it. According to La Flèche and Two Crows, the ceremony
is very simple. The captain tells all present that such a man has
changed his name; then he addresses the Deity in the sky and the one
under the ground: "Thou Deity on either side, hear it; hear ye that
he has taken another name."</p>

<p>According to [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ, the warriors collect clothing and arrows,
which they pile up in the center of the circle. As each man places his
property on the pile, he says, "I, too, O war chief, abandon that name
which is mine!" (This is probably addressed to the Thunder god.)
Then one of the principal captains takes hold of the man by the shoulders,
and leads him all around the circle, following the course of the
sun. When he has finished the circumambulation (which is denied by
La Flèche and Two Crows), the captain asks the man, "What name
will you have, O warrior?" The man replies, "O war chief, I wish to
have such and such a name," repeating the name he wishes to assume.
The captain replies, "The warrior is speaking of having a very precious
name!" Then one of the men is sent to act as crier, to announce the
name to the various deities. The addresses to the deities vary in some
particulars. The following was the proclamation of the Ponka, Cúde-gáxe,
when the chief, Nuda<sup>n</sup>´-axa, received his present name: "He is
truly speaking, as he sits, of abandoning his name, halloo! He is indeed
speaking of having the name Cries-for-the-war-path, halloo! Ye
big head-lands, I tell you and send it (my voice) to you that ye may
hear it, halloo! Ye clumps of buffalo grass, I tell you and send it to
you that ye may hear it, halloo! Ye big trees, I tell you and send it
to you that ye may hear it, halloo! Ye birds of all kinds that walk
and move on the ground, I tell you and send it to you that ye may
hear it, halloo! Ye small animals of different sizes, that walk and
move on the ground, I tell you and send it to you that ye may hear it,
halloo! Thus have I sent to you to tell you, O ye animals! Right in
the ranks of the foe will he kill a very swift man, and come back after
holding him, halloo! He speaks of throwing away the name Naji<sup>n</sup>´-ti¢e,
and he has promised to take the name Nuda<sup>n</sup>´-axa, halloo!" The original
₵egiha will be found on pages 372, 373 of Part I, Vol. VI, "Contributions
to N. A. Ethnology." According to the Omaha [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ, the
following proclamation was made when he received his present name;
but this is disputed by La Flèche and Two Crows:</p>

<p>"He is indeed speaking of abandoning his name! He is indeed speaking
(as he stands) of having the name, He-fears-not-a-Pawnee-when-he-sees-him.
Ye deities on either side (<i>i. e.</i>, darkness and the ground), I
tell you and send it to you that you may hear it, halloo! O Thunder,
even you who are moving in a bad humor, I tell you and send it to you
that you may hear it, halloo! O ye big rocks that move, I tell you and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
send it to you that ye may hear it, halloo! O ye big hills that move, I
tell you and send it to you that ye may hear it, halloo! O ye big trees
that move, I tell you and send it to you that ye may hear it, halloo! O
all ye big worms that move (<i>i. e.</i>, O ye snakes that are in a bad humor,
ye who move), I tell you and send it to you that ye may hear it, halloo!
All ye small animals, I tell you and send it to you that ye may hear it,
halloo! O ye large birds that move, I tell you and send it to you that
you may hear it, halloo!" To this address was added some of the following
promises, all of which were not used for the same person:
"Watí¢ída<sup>n</sup>badíqti wi<sup>n</sup>´ na<sup>n</sup>´pěqti ta<sup>n</sup>´ wégaq¢ `í¢ě ta<sup>n</sup> á¢a!&mdash;<i>He speaks as
he stands of striking down one in the very midst of the ranks of the foe, who
shall stand in great fear of him!</i>" "Watí¢ uhañ´geqti tě´di wi<sup>n</sup>´ wégaq¢
`í¢ě ta<sup>n</sup> á¢a!&mdash;<i>He is speaking of striking down one at the very end of the
ranks of the foe.</i>" "Watí¢e uka<sup>n</sup>´ska ída<sup>n</sup>badiqti wi<sup>n</sup>´ wégaq¢ `í¢ě ta<sup>n</sup>
á¢a!&mdash;<i>He is speaking of striking down one in the very middle of the
enemy's ranks, having gone directly towards him.</i>" "Watí¢e uhañ´gadiqti
wi<sup>n</sup> t'éwaki¢ `í¢ě ta<sup>n</sup> á¢a!&mdash;<i>He is speaking of slaying one at the very end of
the enemy's ranks!</i>" "Gaza<sup>n</sup>´adiqti wi<sup>n</sup> ú ¢iñgé u¢a<sup>n</sup>´ `í¢ě ta<sup>n</sup> á¢a!&mdash;<i>He
is speaking of taking hold of one without a wound right in the midst of the
foe</i> (<i>i. e.</i>, when surrounded by them)!"</p>

<p id="s206">§ 206. <i>Behavior of those who stay at home.</i>&mdash;The old men who stay
at home occasionally act as criers, day and night. They go among the
lodges, and also to the bluffs, where they exhort the absent warriors,
somewhat after this manner: "Do your best. You have gone traveling
(<i>i. e.</i>, on the war path) because you are a man. You are walking over
a land over which it is very desirable for one to walk. Lie (when you
die) in whatever place you may wish to lie. Be sure to lie with your
face towards the foe!" They do not keep this up all the time, nor do
they always make such exhortations.</p>

<p id="s207">§ 207. The women, too, address the distant warriors. The following
is a song referring to Hebadi-ja<sup>n</sup>, of the [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze gens:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wa-na´-q¢i<sup>n</sup>-&#259;! Á-¢a-`a<sup>n</sup>´ ¢á-¢i<sup>n</sup>-cé-i<sup>n</sup>-te</span>
<span class="i0">[T]í-nu-há, ¢a-a<sup>n</sup>´-¢a ca<sup>n</sup>´ ¢a-¢i<sup>n</sup>-cé.</span>
<span class="i0">He-bá-di-ja<sup>n</sup>´, Cá-a<sup>n</sup>-jiñ´-ga kú¢ě a¢i<sup>n</sup> gí-&#259;!"</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hasten! What are you doing that you remain away so long?</span>
<span class="i0">Elder brother, now, at length, you have left him behind.</span>
<span class="i0">O Hebadi-ja<sup>n</sup>! be returning quickly with a young Dakota!</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>La Flèche and Two Crows never heard this song; but they do not
dispute its correctness. It was told the writer by [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ.</p>

<p id="s208">§ 208. <i>Report of scouts.</i>&mdash;When the scouts return and report having
found the enemy, stating also how they are encamped, if the party is
a large one, the sacred bags are opened by the principal captains, with
the mouth of each bag towards the enemy, as stated in § <a href="#s198">198</a>.</p>

<p>[P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ says that they then give the scalp-yell, and each one repeats
what he has promised to do on meeting the enemy; but this is disputed
by La Flèche and Two Crows.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>

<p id="s209">§ 209. <i>Capture of horses.</i>&mdash;Two men who are active go to steal horses
from the enemy. This departure is called "ʇí-gaqá a¢ai," <i>they have
gone to get the better of</i> (those in) <i>the lodges</i> (of the enemy), and is
explained by "wama<sup>n</sup>´¢a<sup>n</sup> a¢aí," <i>they have gone to steal</i>. The two men
may go together or may separate and try to steal horses at whatever
places they can find any. Should these followers fail, two of the officers
must make an attempt. These officers may be either the captains
or the lieutenants. Sometimes a youth steals off from the warriors,
and tries to capture a horse. The policemen try to prevent this, as the
youth might alarm the foe. No matter who captures the horses, he
must deliver them to the two principal captains. If many horses have
been captured, the men take them to a safe distance, and then they are
distributed among the members of the party. He who captured the
horses is always the first to receive one from the captains. Each of the
(principal) captains has his special followers, who are obliged to bring
to him all the horses which they capture. And the captain, in like
manner, shares his booty with his followers. Thus, when [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ
captured horses from the Dakotas, when he was one of the captains,
he distributed eight horses among his own followers. (See p. 442, Part
I, Vol. VI, Contributions to N. A. Ethnology.) When he recovered
the horses from the enemy, the warriors thanked him, saying that on
account of his act they would not be compelled to make their feet
sore from walking home. When but few horses have been taken, only
the elder men receive them; but when many have been captured, all of
the party share alike.</p>

<p id="s210">§ 210. <i>Preparations for attacking the enemy.</i>&mdash;Before the attack is
made, it is usually the custom for scouts to make a thorough survey of
the enemy's camp. So, when Two Crows led his party against the Yanktons,
in 1854, and had discovered the proximity of the foe, he first
sent one of the lieutenants, [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ, to count the lodges. On his
return, another lieutenant, Sĭn´de-xa<sup>n</sup>´xa<sup>n</sup>, was sent by Two Crows, for
the purpose of learning if the enemy were sleeping. The latter having
reported, Two Crows himself, being one of the captains, went with
Sĭnde-xa<sup>n</sup>´xa<sup>n</sup>, to make a final examination. Having ascertained the location
of the sleepers, they returned to their party, and began the attack
at midnight. When [T]ahé-jiñga and Níku¢íb¢a<sup>n</sup> had led a small party
against the Pawnee Loups, they sent back a messenger to the Omaha
camp, and when four scouts were sent from the camp, Wabaskaha, who
was one of the small war party, deceived them, saying that the Cheyennes
were in the camp near at hand. Then many of the Omahas joined the
small party changing it into a nuda<sup>n</sup>hi<sup>n</sup>-ʇañga. This was after the death
of the chief Black Bird, in the early part of this century. When the
main body of the Omahas had joined the others, they proceeded without
delay to surprise the camp of the Pawnees. Having arrived just at the
outside of the village, they crawled towards it in perfect silence, going by
twenties, each one holding the hand of the man next to him. The captain,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
Niku¢ib¢a<sup>n</sup>, or Gia<sup>n</sup>habi, had a sacred bag, which he opened (<i>four times</i>,
said Big Elk) with its mouth towards the foe, that the wind might waft
the magic influence of the bag to the lodges, and make the sleepers forget
their weapons and their warlike spirit (denied by La Flèche and Two
Crows). He also had a war-club with an iron point, which he used as a
sacred thing, waving it four times toward the foe. When they were
very near the lodges, but while it was yet dark, one of the attacking
party pulled his bow with all his might, sending an arrow very far.
But the arrow could not be seen. They continued drawing nearer and
nearer, exhorting one another, but speaking in whispers. At last it
was daylight, which is the usual time for making the attack, as people
are supposed to be sound asleep. Then Niku¢ib¢a<sup>n</sup> pulled his bow, and
sent an arrow, which could be seen. He waved the sacred bag four
times, and gave the attacking cry of the leader (the wa`i<sup>n</sup>´ba<sup>n</sup>) once,
whereupon all of his party gave the scalp-yell (ug¢á`a`a), and began the
fight by shooting at the lodges. (See § <a href="#s193">193</a>.)</p>

<p>Each combatant tries to find a shelter, from behind which he may
fire at the enemy, though brave men now and then expose themselves
to great danger when they rush towards the ranks of the enemy and
try to capture a man, or to inflict a blow on him. Those who are the
first to strike or touch a fallen enemy in the presence of his comrades,
who are generally watching their opportunity to avenge his fall, are
also regarded as very brave.</p>

<p>Protracted warfare, or fighting for several days in succession, has not
been the Omaha custom.</p>

<p id="s211">§ 211. <i>Preparation for an attack on a single foe.</i>&mdash;In the story of I´cibájĭ
of the [T]e-sĭn´de gens, we read thus: "At length the warriors detected
a man coming towards them. They told the war-chief, who said,
'Ho! Oh warriors, he is the one whom we seek. Let us kill him.'
Then the warriors prepared themselves. They painted themselves with
yellow earth and white clay. Icibajĭ picked up the pieces dropped by
the others, and the war-chief made his back yellow for him, in imitation
of the sparrow-hawk. Then the warriors pulled off their leggings
and moccasins, which they gave to Icibajĭ to keep. When Icibajĭ, having
gained the consent of his captain, had peeped over the bluff at the
advancing man, he ran to meet him, having no weapon but his club.
Having overtaken the man, he killed him with the club. And when
the others took parts of the scalp, Icibajĭ did not take any of it."</p>

<p id="s212">§ 212. When one of the principal captains was killed, that always
stopped the fight, even if he belonged to the side of the victors.</p>

<p>If any one heard that one of his kindred was killed or captured, he
would try to go to him, and both generally perished together. When
the Omahas were fleeing from the Dakotas, in a fight which occurred
about A. D. 1846, some one told an old man that his son had been
killed. "Ho!" said he, "I will stop running." So he turned around
and went to the place where his son's body was. He rushed headlong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
among the combatants, who were standing very thick, and at last perished
with his son.</p>

<p id="s213">§ 213. <i>Return of the war-party.</i>&mdash;On the way home the booty is divided.
[P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ said that "They stop for the night at a point
about two miles from the village," but La Flèche and Two Crows deny
this, saying that the warriors come into the village when they please,
as they are hungry and wish to see their wives and children.</p>

<p>If they have brought back scalps or horses, they set the grass afire.
On seeing this the villagers say "Nuda<sup>n</sup>´ ama´ agíi, eb¢e´ga<sup>n</sup>. Usaí."&mdash;<i>I
think that the warriors are coming back. They have set the grass afire.</i>
[P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ said that if they have brought scalps, they put some of
the hair in the fire, and the smoke is black. But if they put a horse's
tail in the fire, the smoke is very yellow.</p>

<p>La Flèche and Two Crows said that there is no difference in the meaning
of the colors of the smoke, though déje jíde or red grass, sidúhi, and
other kinds of grass, are set afire, and make different kinds of smoke.</p>

<p>When guns are fired it signifies that a foe has been killed. But when
none are fired, and the grass is not set afire, it is a sign of an unsuccessful
expedition.</p>

<p>As soon as the people hear the guns, they shout, "The warriors have
come back!" Then the warriors ride back and forth, moving here and
there among themselves in the distance. Then the old men proclaim
through the village what each warrior has achieved, calling him by
name&mdash;"This one has killed a foe!" "This one has broken off a head!"
"This one would not allow the others to anticipate him in seizing one of
the foe by the scalp-lock," etc.</p>

<p id="s214">§ 214. <i>Ordeal of the sacred bags.</i>&mdash;When the warriors have had a rest
of about two days, they assemble for a dance, called the "Wéwatci,"
or Scalp-dance. Before the dance, however, the successful warriors receive
the rewards or insignia of valor from the nuda<sup>n</sup>hañga who has the
three wa¢íxabe ʇañ´ga or wastégistú. The three bags are placed in a row,
and all the warriors stand in a row. Each warrior having selected the
wa¢ixabe to which he intends speaking, he makes a present to it. Then
the keeper of the wa¢ixabe addresses him, reminding him that Wakanda
sees him, and that if he speaks falsely, he may not expect to stay much
longer on the earth. Then the young man says, "Wi<sup>n</sup>´ake. Wakan´da
aká íbaha<sup>n</sup>i."&mdash;<i>I tell the truth. Wakanda knows it.</i> As he says this,
he holds up his right hand towards the sky. Then he addresses the
wa¢ixabe itself, as follows: "Hau, i<sup>n</sup>c`áge-ha! edáda<sup>n</sup> uwíb¢a támiñke
¢a<sup>n</sup>´ja, i¢áusi´cta<sup>n</sup>-májĭ uwíb¢a tá miñke."&mdash;<i>Ho, O venerable man! though
I will tell you something, I will not lie when I tell it to you.</i> When
he says this, he lets fall a small stick which has been cut beforehand.
He is obliged to hold the stick up high when he drops it. Should the
stick fall on the sacred bag and remain there, it is a sign that he has
spoken the truth; but if it falls off, they believe that he has been guilty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
of falsehood, and did not do in the fight that which he has claimed for
himself.</p>

<p><i>Rewards of bravery.</i>&mdash;When all the warriors have thus been tested,
they are addressed by the holder of the wa¢ixabe. To one who was
the first to take hold of a foe, he says, "[K]áxe mí¢ag¢a<sup>n</sup>´te h&#259;," <i>You shall
wear the crow in your belt</i>. Sometimes he adds, "Sábě ¢aʞíckaxe te.
[K]áxe ájaja ¢aʞíckaxe te h&#259;."&mdash;<i>You shall blacken yourself. You shall
make spots on yourself, resembling crows' dung.</i> This warrior must blacken
his body, and then mark here and there spots with white clay.</p>

<p>[P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ said that the second who took hold of a foe had the following
reward: He was allowed to blacken his body from the waist to
the shoulders, and to rub white clay down the tops of his shoulders. To
him was said, "Máca<sup>n</sup>-sk&#259;, ʇáhi<sup>n</sup>-wág¢a<sup>n</sup> á¢ag¢a<sup>n</sup>´ te h&#259;."&mdash;<i>You shall
stick in your hair white eagle feathers, and wear the deer's-tail head-dress.</i>
La Flèche and Two Crows said that this man was allowed to wear the
ʇahi<sup>n</sup>-wag¢a<sup>n</sup> alone on his head, and to put the crow in his belt.</p>

<p>According to [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ, the third warrior who caught hold of the
foe blackened his body thus: On the arms, at the elbows, on the ribs,
and hiusagi, he could make places as large as a hand (or, he could make
one side of his body black&mdash;sic). To him was said, "[T]áhi<sup>n</sup>-wág¢a<sup>n</sup> máca<sup>n</sup>
¢iñgé á¢ag¢a<sup>n</sup>´ te h&#259;," <i>You shall wear the</i> ʇahi<sup>n</sup>-wag¢a<sup>n</sup> <i>without any feathers</i>.
But La Flèche and Two Crows said that this man was told to
wear the crow in his belt; and the fourth who took hold of the foe was
told to wear the ʇahi<sup>n</sup>-wag¢a<sup>n</sup> without any other decoration.</p>

<p>[P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ said that he who disemboweled a fallen enemy with a
knife was permitted to stick a red feather in his hair. He blackened
his body from the waist up to the shoulder, and over the shoulder, then
down the back to the waist. He could redden his knife and dance as
a grizzly bear. But Two Crows, who has attended the scalp-dance,
never saw anything of this sort.</p>

<p>According to [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ, he who killed a foe was rewarded in several
ways. He could wear the ʇehuq¢abe<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> necklace, called the "gadádaje
waci<sup>n</sup>´, and was addressed thus: "Gadádaje waci<sup>n</sup>´ na<sup>n</sup>´¢ap'i<sup>n</sup> te
h&#259;," <i>You can wear the</i> ʇehuq¢abe <i>necklace</i>. "Ma<sup>n</sup>´-u¢úbaski ái¢agá¢a te
h&#259;," <i>You shall carry the ramrod on your arm</i>. "[T]áhi<sup>n</sup>-wág¢a<sup>n</sup> sía<sup>n</sup>¢é
á¢ag¢a<sup>n</sup>´ te h&#259;," <i>You shall wear the</i> ʇahi<sup>n</sup>-wag¢a<sup>n</sup> <i>alone in your hair</i>.
(These were disputed by La Flèche and Two Crows.) "Ma<sup>n</sup>´sa gasú jíde¢ě
na<sup>n</sup>¢ap'i<sup>n</sup>´ te h&#259;," <i>You shall wear an arrow shaft, scraped and reddened,
suspended from your neck</i>. (Confirmed by La Flèche and Two
Crows.)</p>

<p>He who struck a foe with a hatchet, bow, etc., was allowed to redden
it and carry it to the dance, if he wished.</p>

<p>Sometimes a warrior gave a gun, etc., to an old man, who went
through the camp telling of the generosity of the giver.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p>All who had parts of scalps were told to wear ʇahi<sup>n</sup>-wag¢a<sup>n</sup> on their
heads.</p>

<p id="s215">§ 215. <i>The scalp dance</i> (of the women).&mdash;One of the women had to
carry the scalp around on a pole during the dance. This act is ái¢a-báju.</p>

<p>When a man killed a foe with a knife, gun, hatchet, etc., it was taken
by his wife, who held it as she danced. Such women dressed themselves
in gay attire, decorated themselves with various ornaments,
wore head-dresses of ʇeji<sup>n</sup>hi<sup>n</sup>de, painted their cheeks, and reddened the
déugáza<sup>n</sup> or parting of the hair of the head.</p>

<p>This scalp-dance is the women's dance; the men take no part but that
of singing the dancing songs for the women and beating the drums.
When any of the Omahas had been killed by the enemy, this dance could
not be had; but when the Omahas were fortunate enough to kill some
of the foe without losing any of their own party the men said, "Wéwatci
añ´ki¢e taí," <i>Let them dance the scalp-dance</i>. Then the men went first
with one, two, or three drums to a place bare of undergrowth, and began
to beat the drums. By and by the women would hear it, and assemble.
There was no feast and no invitations were made by criers. Any women
and girls who wished to dance could do so. The only men allowed to
sing the dancing songs for the women were those who had killed foes, or
had taken hold of them.</p>

<p>The women did not dance in a circle, but "kiáqpaqpág¢a" (moving in
and out among themselves) and "íki¢íb¢a<sup>n</sup>" (mixed, in disorder), as they
pleased. Sometimes they danced all night till the next morning; sometimes
they continued the dance for two or three days. This wewatci
has not been danced by the Omaha women for about fourteen years. It
is not considered a sacred dance, but one of rejoicing.</p>

<p id="s216">§ 216. The He¢ucka <i>dance</i> (of the men).&mdash;The corresponding dance for
the men is the He¢úcka.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> The only members of the He¢ucka dancing
society are such as have distinguished themselves in war, and boys whose
fathers are chiefs. When Frank La Flèche was a boy he was admitted
to the He¢ucka solely because his father was a chief.</p>

<p>"The first four to take hold of the foe were decorated with the ʇahi<sup>n</sup>-wag¢a<sup>n</sup>
head-dress, the 'crow' in the belt, and garters of otter-skin.</p>

<p>"He who had killed a foe with a gun reddened the barrel for about
nine inches or a foot from the muzzle, wore the 'crow,' and stuck several
swan feathers around the muzzle. He also wore a feather in his hair.</p>

<p>"Those who struck some of the foe, but did not inflict fatal blows,
made on their bodies the signs of blows; having blackened their hands,
they put them here and there on their bodies, leaving black impressions.
Sometimes they blackened the whole body, and over the black they made
white hands, after rubbing white clay on their own hands. They wore
feathers in their hair, as did all except the four who were the first to
take hold of the foe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span></p>

<p>"He who had been wounded by the foe, without receiving a fatal blow,
blackened his body, and put on a red spot and stripe to denote the wound
and the dripping of the blood. He wore a red feather in his hair.</p>

<p>"Those who had brought back horses, wore lariats, "núsi-áq¢a" (over
the left shoulder and under the right arm), and carried their whips on
their arms.</p>

<p>"All these were promoted to the rank of wanáce or policemen, to act
as such during the buffalo hunt." (<i>La Flèche</i> and <i>Two Crows</i>.)</p>

<p>"There were many singers. They had a drum, but no rattles of any
sort. They danced as they moved around the fire-place, from left to
right. This was always after a feast. They had no regular number of
times for dancing around the circle.</p>

<p>"The man who first held a foe ranked as number one; the slayer came
next; the second who held the foe ranked third; the third to hold the
foe ranked fourth, and the fifth was he who cut off the head and threw
it away.</p>

<p>"Sometimes the fourth man did this. Only the first, second, and
third of these men were regarded as having gained great honors, and
these three laded out the food at the feast.</p>

<p>"Only those who held or touched the foe made the impression of hands
on their bodies.</p>

<p>"Those who struck living foes wore feathers erect in their hair, while
those who hit dead enemies had to wear their feathers lying down."
(<i>Frank La Flèche.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. J. La Flèche gave the following as a very ancient song of this
dance:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wakan´da aká a<sup>n</sup>¢iñ´ge te, ai éga<sup>n</sup>,</span>
<span class="i0">A<sup>n</sup>¢iñ´ge támiñke."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wakanda having said that I shall not be,</span>
<span class="i0">I shall not be."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In this song, "A<sup>n</sup>¢iñ´ge ta´miñke" is equivalent to "At'é támiñke," <i>I
shall die</i>. The idea is that the singer thought he would not die until
Wakanda spoke the word, and then he must die. Till then he would

<p id="s217">§ 217. <i>The He-watcí.</i>&mdash;The concluding part of the He¢ucka was called
the "Hé-watcí." It was danced only by one man, a member of the
He¢ucka society. After the feast, the head of a dog or deer was generally
given to one of the guests, who ate it clean and laid it down after
imitating, as he danced, some of his acts in battle. The man arose suddenly
of his own accord, taking the head in both hands and holding it
in front of him. When no head had been boiled he danced without one.
The drum was beaten, but there were no songs. The dancer wore the
"crow," and grasped a club or hatchet, which had been purposely placed
in the middle of the circle. His acts resembled those of the four visitors
when the Égi`a<sup>n</sup>-watcigaxe was danced. (See § <a href="#s271">271</a>.) Pointing in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
various directions with his club or hatchet, with which he struck the
ground each time, he said, "Níaci<sup>n</sup>ga wi<sup>n</sup> gaé`a<sup>n</sup>:" <i>I did thus to a man</i>;
"Níaci<sup>n</sup>ga wi<sup>n</sup> áq¢i," <i>I killed a man</i>; "Níaci<sup>n</sup>ga wi<sup>n</sup> ub¢a<sup>n</sup>," <i>I took hold
of a man</i>; or some other expression. When he finished the He¢ucka
dance was ended.</p>

<p id="s218">§ 218. <i>The Mandan dance with fallen friends.</i>&mdash;When the Omahas
lost any of their number in a fight they had the Mandan dance on their
homeward way, or after they reached home. If they had the bodies of
their dead they placed the latter in the middle of a lodge, making them
sit upright, as if alive and singing. And they made them hold rattles
of deers' claws on their arms.</p>

<p>In the war story of [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ, recorded in Part I, Vol. VI, Contributions
to N. A. Ethnology, the narrator says: "All the people danced
in groups, dancing the Mandan dance. I rode the horse which I had
brought home. I painted my face and wore good clothing. I hit the
drum: 'Ku+!' I said, 'Let Wáqa-náji<sup>n</sup> take that for himself,' referring
to the horse. I presented the horse to one who was not my relation."</p>

<p id="s219">§ 219. When the war party return home, whether they have been successful
or not, the captains invite the warriors to a feast. The warriors,
in turn, invited the captains to a feast. There was no regular
order; if the warriors boiled first they were the first to invite (the captains)
to a feast.</p>

<p id="s220">§ 220. A battle may be ended either by the death of one of the principal
captains or by sending a man with a sacred pipe towards the
ranks of the enemy. The sacred pipe is a peace pipe, and is used instead
of a flag of truce. (See Punishment of a murderer, § <a href="#s309">309</a>.)</p>

<p id="s221">§ 221. <i>Treatment of the wounded foes.</i>&mdash;If they fell into the power of the
men of the victorious side they were killed and their bodies were cut
in pieces, which were thrown towards the retreating foes, who cried
with rage and mortification. Their treatment at the hand of the women
has been described in § <a href="#s184">184</a>.</p>

<p id="s222">§ 222. <i>Treatment of captives.</i>&mdash;Captives were not slain by the Omahas
and Ponkas. When peace was declared the captives were sent home,
if they wished to go. If not they could remain where they were, and
were treated as if they were members of the tribe; but they were not
adopted by any one. When Gahíge-jiñ´ga, father of Wacúce, of the
Iñke-sabě gens, was a small boy he was captured by the Ponkas as
they were fighting with the Omahas, who were camped near their adversaries.
The Omahas having overcome the Ponkas, the latter sent
the aged Hañ´ga-ckáde, whom the Omahas admired, with a peace pipe,
and, as an earnest of their intentions, they sent with him the boy whom
they had captured that day. He was restored to his tribe, and peace
was declared. (See International Law, § <a href="#s306">306</a>.)</p>

<p id="s223">§ 223. <i>Bravery.</i>&mdash;The following anecdotes were told by Mr. La Flèche
as illustrating the bravery of his people:</p>

<p>An old man had a son who reached manhood, and went into a fight,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
from which he returned wounded, but not dangerously so. The son
asked his father saying, "Father, what thing is hard to endure?" He
expected the father to say, "My child, for one to be wounded in battle
is hard to endure." Had he said this, the son would have replied, "Yes,
father; I shall live." The father suspected this, so he made a different
reply: "Nothing, my child. The only thing hard to bear is to put on
leggings again before they have been warmed by the fire." So the son
became angry and said, "My father, I will die."</p>

<p>A certain old man had been very brave in his youth; he had gone
many times on the war-path, and had killed many persons belonging to
different tribes. His only children were two young men. To them he
gave this advice: "Go on the war-path. It will be good for you to die
when young. Do not run away. I should be ashamed if you were
wounded in the back; but it would delight me to learn of your being
wounded in the chest." By and by there was war with another tribe,
and the two young men took part in it. Their party having been scared
back, both young men were killed. When the men reached home some
one said, "Old man, your sons were killed." "Yes," said he, "that is
just what I desired. I will go to see them. Let them alone; I will
attend to them." He found the eldest son wounded all along the back,
but lying with his face towards home. Said he, "W&#259;! kí ga<sup>n</sup>´¢aqti kéana.
Gátěʇa úgaq¢e ¢aja<sup>n</sup>´ te, ehé ¢a<sup>n</sup>´ctĭ."&mdash;<i>Why! he lies as if he felt a
strong desire to reach home! I said heretofore that you were to lie
facing that way.</i> So taking hold of his arms, he threw the body in
the other direction, with the face towards the enemy. He found the
younger son wounded in the chest, and lying with his face toward the
foe. "Ho! this is my own son. He obeyed me!" And the father
kissed him.</p>

<p id="s224">§ 224. <i>Grades of merit or bravery</i>, Úwahéhajĭ-má, were of two sorts.
To the first class belonged such as had given to the poor on many occasions,
and had invited guests to many feasts, being celebrated for the
latter as "wéku-cta<sup>n</sup>." To the second class belonged those, who, besides
having done these things many times, had killed several of the
foe and had brought home many horses. In connection with war customs,
see Property (Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">XII</a>), and Regulative Industries (Chapter
<a href="#CHAPTER_XI">XI</a>).</p>

<p>Another protective industry is the practice of medicine. (See Dancing

<p id="s226">§ 226. <i>Proverbs</i>, Wíu¢a.&mdash;Sometimes they say of an obstinate man,
"Waníʇa éga<sup>n</sup> áha<sup>n</sup>," <i>He is like an animal</i>, meaning that he is "naxíde-¢iñgé."
Another ancient comparison is this: "Jé éga<sup>n</sup> áha<sup>n</sup>. Wana<sup>n</sup>´pajĭ
áha<sup>n</sup>."&mdash;<i>He is like the membrum virile! He fears the sight of nothing!</i>
This refers to a bad man, who fears not to commit a wrong, but
pushes ahead, in spite of opposition, or, as the Omahas say, "áʞi[p]atcíje,"
regardless of the consequences to others or to himself.</p>

<p id="s227">§ 227. <i>Puns.</i>&mdash;Two youths accompanied their mother's brother when
he hunted game. Having killed a deer, the two young men proceeded
to cut it up, while the uncle looked on. He made this observation to
them: "Sábě a<sup>n</sup>¢a<sup>n</sup>´da ¢a<sup>n</sup>´ja, ga<sup>n</sup>´adi í¢isábe h&#259;."&mdash;Though I was born
<i>black</i> (sabě), now you <i>suffer</i> (i¢isabe).</p>

<h3 id="GAMES">GAMES.</h3>

<p id="s228">§ 228. <i>Plumstone shooting</i>, [K]a<sup>n</sup>´-si kíde.&mdash;This game was thus described
by Dougherty. "Five plumstones are provided, three of which
are marked on one side only with a greater or smaller number of black
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
dots or lines, and two of them are marked on both sides; they are, however,
sometimes made of bone of a rounded or flattened form, somewhat
like an orbicular button-mold, the dots in this case being impressed.
A wide dish and a certain number of small sticks by the way of counters
are also provided. Any number of persons may play this game,
and agreeably to the number engaged in it, is the quantity of sticks or
counters. The plumstones or bones are placed in a dish, and a throw
is made by simply jolting the vessel against the ground to make the
seeds or bones rebound, and they are counted as they lie when they fall.
The party plays around for the first throw. Whoever gains all the sticks
in the course of the game wins the stake. The throws succeed each
other with so much rapidity that we vainly endeavored to observe their
laws of computation, which it was the sole business of an assistant to
attend to."</p>

<p>The seeds used in this game are called ʞa<sup>n</sup>´-si gě. Their number varies.
Among the Ponkas and Omahas, only five are used, while the Otos
play with six. Sometimes four are marked alike, and the fifth is black
or white (unmarked). Generally three are black on one side, and white
or unmarked on the other, while two have each a star on one side and
a moon on the other.</p>

<p>The players must always be of the same sex and class; that is, men
must play with men, youths with youths, and women with women.</p>

<p>There must always be an even number of players, not more than two
on each side. There are about twenty sticks used as counters. These
are made of deska or of some other grass.</p>

<p>The seed are put in a bowl, which is hit against a pillow, and not on
the bare ground, lest it should break the bowl.</p>

<p>When three seeds show black, and two have the moon on the upper
side, it is a winning throw; but when one is white, one black, a third
black (or white), the fourth showing a moon, and the fifth a star, it is a
losing throw. The game is played for small stakes, such as rings and
necklaces.</p>

<p id="s229">§ 229. Banañ´ge-kíde, <i>Shooting at the</i> banañge or <i>rolling wheel</i>.&mdash;This
is played by two men. Each one has in his hand two sticks about as
thick as one's little finger, which are connected in the middle by a thong
not over four inches in length. The sticks measure about three feet
and a half in length. Those of one player are red, and those of the
other are black. The wheel which is rolled is about two feet and a
half in diameter, its rim is half an inch thick, and it extends about an
inch from the circumference towards the center. On this side of the
rim that measures an inch are four figures. The first is called "Máxu,"
<i>Marked with a knife</i>, or "Mág¢eze," <i>Cut in stripes with a knife</i>. The
second is "Sábě tě," <i>The black one</i>. The third is "Áki¢ítě," <i>Crossing
each other</i>. The fourth is "Jiñgá tcě," <i>The little one</i>, or "Máxu jiñgá
tcě," <i>The little one marked with a knife</i>. The players agree which one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
of the figures shall be "waqúbe" for the game; that is, what card-players
call "trumps."</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>&mdash;The banañge.</p>
</div>

<p>The wheel is pushed and caused to roll along, and when it has almost
stopped each man hits gently at it
to make it fall on the sticks. Should
the sticks fall on the top of the
wheel, it does not count. When a
player succeeds in lodging his sticks
in such a way that he touches the
waqube, he wins many sticks, or
arrows. When figures are touched
by one or both of his sticks, he calls
out the number. When any two of
the figures have been touched, he
says, "Na<sup>n</sup>ba<sup>n</sup>´a-ú h&#259;,"<i>I have
wounded it twice</i>. If three figures have been
hit, he says, "₵áb¢i<sup>n</sup> a-ú h&#259;,"<i>I have
wounded three</i>. Twenty arrows or
sticks count as a blanket, twenty-five as a gun, and one hundred as a horse.</p>

<p id="s230">§ 230. [T]abé-gasi, <i>Men's game of ball.</i>&mdash;This is played by the Omahas
and Ponkas with a single ball. There are thirty, forty, or fifty men on
each side, and each one is armed with a curved stick about two feet long.
The players strip off all clothing
except their breech-cloths. At
each end of the play-ground are
two posts from 12 to 15 feet apart.
The play-ground is from 300 to
400 yards in length. When the
players on the opposite side see
that the ball is liable to reach A
they try to knock it aside, either
towards B or C, as their opponents
would win if the ball passed between
the posts at A. On the
other hand, if the party represented
by A see that the ball is
in danger of passing between the posts at D they try to divert it, either
towards E or F.</p>

<p>The stakes may be leggings, robes, arrows, necklaces, etc. All are
lost by the losing side, and are distributed by the winners in equal
shares. One of the elder
men is requested to make
the distribution. Two
small boys, about twelve
years old, stand at the
posts A, and two others
are at D. One boy at each
end tries to send the ball
between the posts, but the
other one attempts to send
it in the opposite direction.
These boys are called uhé
gináji<sup>n</sup>.</p>

<p>The game used to be
played in three ways: (1.)
Phratry against phratry.
Then one of the players was
not blindfolded. (2.) Village
against village. The Omahas had three villages after 1855. Bi-kú-de was
Gahige's village, where most of the people were. Wi<sup>n</sup>-dja´-ge was Standing
Hawk's village, near the Mission. Ja<sup>n</sup>-¢a´-te was Sanssouci's village,
near Decatur. Frank La Flèche remembers one occasion when Wi<sup>n</sup>-djage
challenged Bikude to play ʇabe-gasi, and the former won. (3.)
When the game was played neither by phratries nor by villages, sides
were chosen thus: A player was blindfolded, and the sticks were placed
before him in one pile, each stick having a special mark by which its
owner could be identified. The blindfolded man then took up two sticks
at a time, one in each hand, and, after crossing hands, he laid the
sticks in separate piles. The owners of the sticks in one pile formed a
side for the game. The corresponding women's game is Wabaᴐnade.</p>

<p id="s231">§ 231. [P]á¢i<sup>n</sup>-jáhe, or <i>Stick and ring</i>.&mdash;[P]á¢i<sup>n</sup>-jáhe is a game played
by two men. At each end of the play-ground, there are two "búʇa,"
or rounded heaps of earth.</p>

<p>A ring of rope or hide, the wa¢ígije, is rolled along the ground, and
each player tries to dart a stick through it as it goes. He runs very
swiftly after the hoop, and thrusts the stick with considerable force.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
If the hoop turns aside as it rolls it is not so difficult to thrust a stick
through it.</p>

<p>The stick (A) is about 4 feet long. D is the end that is thrust at the
hoop. BB are the gaqa or forked ends for catching at the hoop. CC
are made of ha násage, wéabasta násage íka<sup>n</sup>ta<sup>n</sup>, <i>stiff hide, fastened to
the forked ends with stiff</i> "weabasta," or <i>material used for
soles of moccasins</i>. These ha nasage often serve to prevent
the escape of the hoop from the forked ends. Sometimes
these ends alone catch or hook the hoop. Sometimes the
end D is thrust through it. When both sticks catch the
hoop neither one wins.</p>

<p id="s232">§ 232. Wabáᴐnade, <i>the women's game of ball</i>.&mdash;Two balls of hide are
filled with earth, grass, or fur, and then joined by a cord. At each end
of the play-ground are two "gabázu" or hills of earth, blankets, &amp;c.,
that are from 12 to 15 feet apart. Each pair of hills may be regarded
as the "home" or "base" of one of the contending parties, and it is
the aim of the members of each party to throw the balls between their
pair of hills, as that would win the game.</p>

<p>Two small girls, about twelve years old, stand at each end of the
play-ground and act as uhe ginaji<sup>n</sup> for the women, as boys do for the
men in ʇabe-gasi.</p>

<p>Each player has a webaᴐnade, a very small stick of hard or red willow,
about 5 feet long, and with this she tries to pick up the balls by
thrusting the end of the stick under the cord. Whoever succeeds in
picking them up hurls them into the air, as in playing with grace
hoops. The women can throw these balls very far. Whoever catches
the cord on her stick in spite of the efforts of her opponents, tries to
throw it still further, and closer to her "home." The stakes are buffalo
hides, small dishes or bowls, women's necklaces, awls, &amp;c. The
bases are from 300 to 400 yards apart. The corresponding men's game
is [T]abe-gasi.</p>

<p id="s233">§ 233. Ja<sup>n</sup>-¢áwa, <i>Stick counting</i>, is played by any number of persons with
sticks made of [p]éska or sidúhi. These sticks are all placed in a heap,
and then the players in succession take up some of them in their hands.
The sticks are not counted till they have been taken up, and then he
who has the lowest odd number always wins. Thus, if one player had
five, another three, and a third only one the last must be the victor.
The highest number that any one can have is nine. If ten or more
sticks have been taken, those above nine do not count. With the exception
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
of horses, anything may be staked which is played for in banañge-kide.</p>

<p id="s234">§ 234. Ma<sup>n</sup>-gádaze is a game unknown among the Omahas, but practiced
among the Ponkas, who have learned it from the Dakotas. It is
played by two men. Each one holds a bow upright in his left hand
with one end touching the ground and the bow-string towards a heap
of arrows. In the other hand he holds an arrow, which he strikes
against the bow-string, which rebounds as he lets the arrow go. The
latter flies suddenly towards the heap of arrows and goes among them.
The player aims to have the feather on his arrow touch that on some
other arrow which is in the heap. In that case he wins as many arrows
as the feather or web has touched; but if the sinew on his arrow touches
another arrow it wins not only that one but all in the heap.</p>

<p id="s235">§ 235. I<sup>n</sup>´-uti<sup>n</sup>´, <i>Hitting the stone</i>, is a game played at night. Sometimes
there are twenty, thirty, or forty players on each side. Four moccasins
are placed in a row, and a member of one party covers them, putting
in one of them some small object that can be easily concealed. Then
he says "Come! hit the moccasin in which you think it is." Then one
of the opposite side is chosen to hit the moccasin. He arises, examines
all, and hits one. Should it be empty, they say, "₵iñgéě h&#259;," <i>It is
wanting</i>." He throws it far aside and forfeits his stakes. Three moccasins
remain for the rest of his friends to try. Should one of them hit
the right one (uska<sup>n</sup>´ska<sup>n</sup> uti<sup>n</sup>´, <i>or</i> uka<sup>n</sup>´ska uti<sup>n</sup>´), he wins the stakes,
and his side has the privilege of hiding the object in the moccasin. He
who hits the right moccasin can hit again and again till he misses.
Sometimes it is determined to change the rule for winning, and then
the guesser aims to avoid the right moccasin the first time, but to hit
it when he makes the second trial. Should he hit the right one the
first time he loses his stakes. If he hits the right one when he hits the
second moccasin, he wins, and his side has the right to hide the object.
They play till one side or the other has won all the sticks or stakes.
Sometimes there are players who win back what they have lost. He
who takes the right moccasin wins four sticks, or any other number
which may be fixed upon by previous agreement.</p>

<p>Eight sticks win a blanket; four win leggings; one hundred sticks,
a full-grown horse; sixty sticks, a colt; ten sticks, a gun; one, an arrow;
four, a knife or a pound of tobacco; two, half a pound of tobacco.
Buffalo robes (meha), otter skins, and beaver skins are each equal to
eight sticks. Sometimes they stake moccasins.</p>

<p>When one player wins all his party yell. The men of each party sit
in a row, facing their opponents, and the moccasins are placed between
them.</p>

<p id="s236">§ 236. <i>Shooting arrows at a mark is</i> called "Ma<sup>n</sup> kíde." The mark
(nacábeg¢e tě) may be placed at any distance from the contestants.
There must be an even number of persons on each side. Men play with
men and boys with boys. Arrows are staked. Sometimes when an arrow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
hits squarely at the mark it wins eight arrows or perhaps ten, according
to previous agreement. When no arrow hits the mark squarely
and one touches it, that arrow wins. And if there is neither an arrow
that hits the mark squarely nor one that barely touches it, then the nearest
arrow wins. Should there be no arrow that has gone nearly to the
mark, but one that has gone a little beyond it and descended, that one
wins. Whichever one is nearest the mark always wins. If there are
two arrows equidistant from the mark which belong to opposite sides in
the game neither one wins; but if the equidistant arrows are on the
same side both win. Sometimes they say, "Let us finish the game
whenever any one hits the mark squarely." Then he who thus hits the
mark wins all the arrows staked.</p>

<p id="s237">§ 237. <i>Shooting at a moccasin.</i>&mdash;Hi<sup>n</sup>be kide is a boy's game. An arrow
is stuck in the ground and a moccasin is fastened to it. Each boy rides
swiftly by and shoots at the moccasin. The game resembles the preceding
one.</p>

<p id="s238">§ 238. Ma<sup>n</sup>-múqpe, <i>The game of dislodging arrows</i>, is common to the
Omahas, Ponkas, Iowas, Otos, and Missouris. Arrows are shot up into
a tree till they lodge among the branches; then the players shoot up
and try to dislodge them. Whoever can bring down an arrow wins it.
There are no sides or opposing parties. Any number of boys can play.
The game has become obsolete among the Omahas as there are no arrows
now in use.</p>

<p id="s239">§ 239. Ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>´-bagí, Wahí-gasnug´-i¢e (Omaha names), or Ma<sup>n</sup>-íbagí
(Ponka name) is a game played by an even number of boys. The tall
sticks of the red willow are held in the hand, and, when thrown towards
the ground so as to strike it at an acute angle, they glance off, and are
carried by the wind into the air for some distance. Whichever one can
throw his stick the furthest wins the game; but nothing is staked.</p>

<p id="s240">§ 240. Man´dě gasnug´-i¢e is a game similar to Ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>-bagi, but bows
are used instead of the red willow sticks and arrows are staked, there
being an even number of players on each side. Each bow is unstrung,
one end being nearly straight, the other end, which is to hit the ground,
being slightly curved. When snow is on the ground the bows glide
very far. Sometimes the bow rebounds and goes into the air, then
alights and glides still further. The prize for each winning bow is arranged
before each game. If the number be two arrows for each and
three bows win, six arrows are forfeited by the losing side; if four bows
win eight arrows are lost. If three arrows be the prize for each, when
two bows win, six arrows are forfeited; when three win, nine arrows;
and so on.</p>

<p id="s241">§ 241. I<sup>n</sup>´-ti<sup>n</sup> búʇa, a boy's game among the Omahas, is played in winter.
It is played by two, three, or four small boys, each one having a stick,
not over a yard long, shaped like the figure. The stakes are necklaces
and ear-rings; or, if they have no stakes they agree to hit once on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
head the boy whose stick goes the shortest distance. The sticks are
thrown as in Ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>-bagi.</p>

<p id="s242">§ 242. <i>Diving.</i>&mdash;Boys dive and see who can go the farthest under water.
Some put grass in their mouths previous to diving; and when they
get under water they blow through the grass, causing bubbles to rise
to the surface and mark their course. He who goes the shortest distance
can be struck by the winner with the robe of the latter.</p>

<p id="s243">§ 243. <i>Children's games.</i>&mdash;Children play in the mud, making lodges, etc.;
hence the verb "ʇi´-gaxe," <i>to make</i> (mud) <i>lodges</i>, to play as children do.
The girls used to make dolls of sticks, and place them in small u¢uhe.
Now, some of them make rag dolls.</p>

<p>Children strike one another "last," saying, "Gatca<sup>n</sup>´," <i>i. e.</i>, "So far."</p>

<p>[T]aha¢ija is played by two persons. A's left hand is at the bottom,
the skin on its back is pinched by B's left hand, which, in turn,
is pinched by A's right, and that by B's right. After saying "[T]aha¢ija"
twice as they raise and lower the hands, they release them and hit
at each other. The Kansas call the game Taleska. These two customs
were observed among the Ponka children.</p>

<p id="s244">§ 244. <i>Games with playing cards.</i>&mdash;Since coming in contact with our
race the Omahas have learned to play several games with cards; and
a few can play checkers and backgammon, though they are hardly familiar
with our language.</p>

<p>Dougherty says, "Various are the games which they practice, of which
is one called <i>Matrimony</i>, but others are peculiar to themselves. The following
is one to which they seem to be particularly devoted:</p>

<p>"The players seat themselves around a bison robe, spread on the
ground, and each individual deposits in the middle the articles which
he intends to stake, such as vermilion, beads, knives, blankets, etc.,
without any attention to the circumstance of equalizing its value with
the deposits made by his companions. Four small sticks are then laid
upon the robe and the cards are shuffled, cut, and two are given to each
player, after which the trump is turned. The hands are then played,
and whoever gains two tricks takes one of the sticks. If two persons
make each a trick, they play together until one loses his trick, when the
other takes a stick. The cards are again dealt and the process is continued
until all the sticks are taken. If four persons have each a stick
they continue to play to the exclusion of the unsuccessful gamesters.
When a player wins two sticks, four cards are dealt to him that he may
take his choice of them. If a player wins three sticks, six cards are
dealt to him, and should he take the fourth stick he wins the stakes."</p>

<p id="s245">§ 245. <i>Musicians.</i>&mdash;These included the musicians for special occasions,
as the Quʞa for the service of the keepers of the sacred tents of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
Hañga (see Hunting customs, § <a href="#s143">143</a>), the singers for the Hede-watci,
who were Iñke-sabě men, and the musicians for the dancing societies,
etc.</p>

<h3 id="CORPORATIONS_2">CORPORATIONS.</h3>

<h4 id="FEASTING_SOCIETIES">FEASTING SOCIETIES.</h4>

<p id="s246">§ 246. <i>Feasting societies</i> or Úkikuné¢ě (called Ukíkune¢ě by the Ponkas)
were of three kinds; that for the men, that for the young men,
and one for youths in their teens. No business was transacted, and
there was neither singing nor dancing as an essential part of the proceedings.
They were merely social gatherings, intended chiefly for
the purpose of feasting, and they were fostered by the state, as they
tended to bind together as friends all who were present as guests.</p>

<p>Joseph La Flèche used to be a member of the society of the married
men and aged men. When he did not go to the feast he could send
his son, Frank; and other men were allowed to send their sons as
proxies. This society is now extinct. The giver of the feast used to
place in the middle of the lodge a large wooden bowl, which was empty.
Beside it was laid a very red spoon, made of buffalo horn. The bowl
and spoon were not used by any of the guests.</p>

<p>The society of the young men, which became extinct about A. D. 1879,
was called, "Hi<sup>n</sup>be hi<sup>n</sup> t`a<sup>n</sup>, <i>Hairy Moccasins</i>." To this belonged Hidaha,
of the Elk gens, Huta<sup>n</sup>ta<sup>n</sup>, of the Ictasanda, and many others. They
invited any one whom they wished to join their society. A pipe was
smoked whenever they assembled.</p>

<p>There was a society for youths from seventeen to nineteen years of
age, but its name cannot be recalled by Frank La Flèche. (See §§ <a href="#s18">18</a>,
<a href="#s111">111</a>, <a href="#s130">130</a>.)</p>

<h4 id="DANCING_SOCIETIES">DANCING SOCIETIES.</h4>

<p id="s247">§ 247. <i>The dancing societies</i> of the Omahas and Ponkas may be divided
into the following classes: 1. Those which are "waqube," or sacred, including
those connected with the practice of medicine. 2. Those that
are "úwacúce-aʇá¢ica<sup>n</sup>," or connected with bravery and war. 3. Those
that are "újawa-ʇá¢ica<sup>n</sup>," or merely for social pleasure. They admit of
another classification, i. e., 1. Those of native origin; and, 2,. such as
have been introduced or purchased from other tribes.</p>

<p id="s248">§ 248. <i>The Wacicka dance.</i>&mdash;The Wacícka a¢i<sup>n</sup>´-ma or Wacícka a¢i<sup>n</sup>´-watcígaxe
is the name of the principal society. The [T]ᴐiwere name for
it is "Wacúckanyi." This society appears to exist under different names
among many tribes besides the Omahas, including the Winnebagos,
Dakotas, and Odjibwe or Chippewas.</p>

<p>The writer has received conflicting accounts of the character of this
dance. [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ spoke of it as one that was "waspe," <i>well-behaved</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
Mr. J. La Flèche and Two Crows used the following expressions with
reference to it: "Úʞiju gáxai," <i>it tended to pride</i>; "úgactañka gáxai,"
<i>it tended to temptation</i>; "úma<sup>n</sup>¢a<sup>n</sup> gáxai," <i>it tended to theft</i>; "úmi<sup>n</sup>¢íg¢a<sup>n</sup>
gaxai," <i>it tended to concupiscence</i>; "íqta-hna<sup>n</sup>i," <i>they used to
abuse persons</i>; "watcí," <i>cum aliquibus coiverunt</i>. The dancers used to
dress so as to attract those of the opposite sex. The leaders or "í¢ig¢a<sup>n</sup>"
of the dance are G¢eda<sup>n</sup>-naji<sup>n</sup> and [P]edegahi. The other members whose
names are remembered by Two Crows and others are Wacka<sup>n</sup>-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>,
Duba-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>, Maja<sup>n</sup>-kide, Cañge-sk&#259;, Jiñga-gahige, Ha<sup>n</sup>-akipa, the wives
of G¢eda<sup>n</sup>naji<sup>n</sup>, [P]ede-gahi, and Wacka<sup>n</sup>-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>, [K]e-baha's mother, and
[K]a<sup>n</sup>ze-hañga's mother's sister. "Besides these are Muxa-naji<sup>n</sup>, Jiñga-gahige's
mother, Wacka<sup>n</sup>-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>'s son, Uma<sup>n</sup>ha<sup>n</sup>-ta<sup>n</sup>wañg¢a<sup>n</sup>, and many
others." (<i>Frank La Flèche.</i>) The full number is nineteen. All the
chiefs can belong to this society, and their younger brothers, wives, eldest
daughters, and sisters' sons are eligible. Waha<sup>n</sup>-¢iñge's larger wife,
A<sup>n</sup>pa<sup>n</sup>-ʇañga's sister, used to be a member.</p>

<p>Not over five can carry otter-skin bags in the dance. Four of these are
Duba-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>, Jiñga-gahige, Cañge-sk&#259;, and Maja<sup>n</sup>-kide. G¢eda<sup>n</sup>-naji<sup>n</sup> is
one of the two that can carry bags made of the skins of the siñga or flying-squirrels.
Ha<sup>n</sup>-akipa carries a bag made of the skin of a miʞa-sk&#259; or
"white raccoon." This is a modern addition. [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ said that
some have bags of the skin of the máza<sup>n</sup>he, an animal resembling an
otter; it is covered with black and reddish-yellow hair; its tail is bushy,
and the hair is thick. J. La Flèche and Two Crows said that this kind
of bag was not used by the Omahas. The parents of G¢eda<sup>n</sup>-naji<sup>n</sup>
([T]e-sa<sup>n</sup> and wife) carried a bag of black bear skin, but the son did not
inherit it.</p>

<p>If they cannot have the regular kind of bags, some make bags of the
skins of muskrats, or of any other animal which they can obtain.</p>

<p>All who have no skin bags carry fans of eagles' wings. All the bags
are called "Hi-úgaqíxe," a term meaning "A skin with the teeth of the
animal attached," and they are used as nini-ujiha, or tobacco pouches.
The noses of all the animals (<i>i. e.</i>, those on the bags) were painted blue.
Of the otter-skin bags about two had each a red feather placed crosswise
in the mouth of the animal.</p>

<p id="s249">§ 249. This dance is held in the spring of the year, beginning on a
good day, when the grass is about six inches high. After an intermission
of a few days they may have the dance again, if they wish; then,
after a similar intermission, they may repeat it, and so on.</p>

<p>Before holding the dance one of the members, an old man, says to
the leaders, "Do consider the subject; I will boil (for the feast)." They
reply, "Yes, we will have it; you can boil." Then the members must
borrow two drums, four gourd rattles, and two pillows. These articles
must always be borrowed, as it would be wrong for the members to make
or furnish them. Four persons undertake the boiling for the feast.
Some brave men are selected to act as "quʞa," part of whom, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
are members of the society. Two are appointed to beat the drums, and
four to beat the rattles on the pillows. These six performers are not
members of the society.</p>

<p id="s250">§ 250. When one wishes to join the society he must proceed as follows:
During the day the candidate boils food for a feast, to which he invites
all the members of the society. About twilight they arrive, and having
partaken of the feast they receive presents from the candidate,
who asks them to admit him to their society. If they agree to admit
him a feast is appointed for the next day in connection with the dance,
when he will be initiated. Before the ceremony, however, the chiefs
confer with one another, saying, "Wí ab¢i<sup>n</sup>´ támiñke. Níkaci<sup>n</sup>´ga wágazu´ga<sup>n</sup>,
ab¢i<sup>n</sup>´ támiñke. U¢úka<sup>n</sup>pi téga<sup>n</sup> ab¢i<sup>n</sup>´ támiñke."&mdash;<i>I will have
him. I will have him, as he is an honest man. I will have him, as he will
be a fine looking person.</i></p>

<p id="s251">§ 251. <i>Dress and ornaments of the dancers.</i>&mdash;Two Crows says that they
used to wear deer-skin leggings. He says that there is no uniform dress
for members of either sex. [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ gave the following: The men
wear red leggings, of which each leg comes down over the moccasin in a
point. Ribbon-work in two parts that cross over the moccasins shakes
when the wearer dances. Two kinds of garters are worn together; one
kind is of otter-skin, the other of bead-work and ʇeji<sup>n</sup>hi<sup>n</sup>de.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> This ʇeji<sup>n</sup>hi<sup>n</sup>de
part is fastened over the legging-flap on the outer side of each leg,
and is "zázade" (extending apart like the sticks of a fan) and dangling.
The flaps of the leggings, which are as wide as a hand, contain ribbon-work
generally from the knee up, and sometimes the whole length of
the leggings. When a member wears no shirt he may ornament his body
with a dozen "wa¢íg¢eze," or convoluted lines. These are red, six in
front and six on the back; of those in front, two are at the waist, two
higher up on the chest, and two on the arm; and of those on the back
two are near the nape of the neck, two lower down, and two just above
the waist. A red stripe about a finger wide is put on the face, extending
from each side of the mouth to the jaw, and similar stripes are drawn
down on the sides of the nose. [T]eji<sup>n</sup>hi<sup>n</sup>de head-dresses are worn, and
some have deer's tail head-dresses on their heads, surmounted by very
white feathers, which are waving slowly as the dancers move. Two
Crows says that they now turn down the flaps or hi<sup>n</sup>bédiha of the moccasins.</p>

<p>The women's attire consists of a gay calico body or sacque, ornamented
with two rows of small pieces of silver as large as copper cents, extending
all around the neck of the garment; leggings with an abundance
of ribbon embroidered on the flaps; short garters of ʇeji<sup>n</sup>hi<sup>n</sup>de and
bead-work; moccasins dyed black and ornamented with porcupine
work, and a red or black blanket.</p>

<p>[P]é-ugácke úi<sup>n</sup>, ear-bobs, are worn.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span></p>

<p>The parting of the hair is reddened, and a narrow red stripe is made
from the temple to the jaw.</p>

<p>Two Crows says that there are different styles of putting the paint on
the eyes, etc., with the exception of the two methods given above, which
never vary.</p>

<p id="s252">§ 252. The dance may take place out of doors, or else in an earth-lodge.
It is started by the leaders, who begin the song, which is then
taken up by the singers. The dancers form a circle, and around this they
dance, following the course of the sun, according to [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>-pajĭ. There
are different steps in the dance, and each person keeps time with the
beating of the drums.</p>

<p>[P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ says that the wacicka is as thick as a pencil, and is
about a half an inch long. It is white. It is generally shot at the candidate
by a member who is not one of his kindred, though the kinsman may
do the shooting. It is generally given "wa¢íᴐnajĭ," <i>invisibly</i>, being shot
from the mouth of the possessor into that of the candidate, lodging in
his throat near the Adam's apple, and knocking him down. Then the
candidate staggers and coughs, "Ha! ha!" (whispered). He hits himself
on the back of his head and dislodges the wacicka into his hand, where
it lies white. A sacred bag is also given to the candidate. The wacicka
is always kept in the mouth of the otter (that is, in the hi-ugaqixe), except
when the owner wishes to shoot it from his mouth (at a candidate?),
according to [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ. But J. La Flèche and Two Crows say that
the wacicka is spit into the mouth of an otter when they wish to use it
in the dance.</p>

<p>A few of those carrying bags imitate the cry of the otter or that of
the flying squirrel: "Tcu! tcu! tcu! tcu! tcu!" (in thirty-second notes).
Each one has a small piece of wood that has been hollowed with a
knife, and feathers that have been cut thin have been fastened on the
wood, making a whistle which causes the imitation of the cry of those
animals. On each bag some bells are put on the tail of the animal, and
porcupine work is around the legs. The dancer holds the head in one
hand and the tail in the other. It is aimed at the person to be shot at.
None are thus shot at but members and candidates.</p>

<p id="s253">§ 253. <i>Order of shooting.</i>&mdash;All stand in a circle. Then four of their
number are placed in the middle, standing in a row. They who do the
shooting remain in the circle, and each one of them shoots at one of the
four in the middle. When the latter or the second four have "gaᴐnúde"
(<i>i. e.</i>, have made the wacicka come out of their throats by hitting themselves
on the back of the neck), they return to their places in the circle,
and the four who shot at them step into the center and are shot at by
a third four. When the second four have "gaᴐnúde," they return to
their places, and the third four take their places in the middle; and so
on till all have been shot at once. Then the first four step into the center
again, and the last four shoot at them. This ends the dance.</p>

<p id="s254">§ 254. None but members can take part in the dance, and the "úwaweqáqa."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
This uwaweqaqa or iqta was never witnessed by J. La Flèche
and Two Crows. No one ever said to them, "I saw the uwaweqaqa in
the Wacicka dance." But they have heard persons speak in ridicule
of a woman who joined the dance without her husband. Of course, if
the woman's husband or other kinsman was present, he would be unwilling
for any stranger to abuse his wife or kinswoman. The women
admitted to this society were not necessarily the tattooed women.</p>

<p>That there is some foundation for the statement that lewd rites occurred
during some part of the dance is more probable after a comparison
of the season for this dance with the Ponka phrase, "Wíhe, déje
t`a<sup>n</sup>. A<sup>n</sup>¢añ´giqtá!"&mdash;<i>My little sister</i> (or <i>my female friend</i>), <i>grass abounds</i>.
<i>(Let) us delight in each other!</i> Frank La Flèche thinks that this is
without foundation. He says that four days were spent in the secret
initiation, the public ceremony taking place on the last day.</p>

<p id="s255">§ 255. When Frank La Flèche witnessed the public ceremony in the
lodge the members were stationed all around the circle. The four candidates
were placed between the fire-place and the door, and thence they
began to dance around the fire, moving from left to right. As they
were dancing around, one of the members having an otter-skin bag left
the outer circle, and began to follow them, moving in a circle between
that of the dancers and that of the members. While the singing was
going on, he shot at each of the four candidates with his sacred bag.
After these were shot at, all the members danced, and then any one of
them was at liberty to shoot at the others.</p>

<p id="s256">§ 256. <i>The I<sup>n</sup>-kug¢i dance.</i>&mdash;I<sup>n</sup>´-kug¢i a¢i<sup>n</sup>´-ma, <i>or</i> Qubé i<sup>n</sup>´-kug¢i a¢i<sup>n</sup>´-ma,
<i>The society of those who have the translucent stones</i>. [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajï says
that this is a bad dance, the members being "wáspajĭ." Each member
has one of the i<sup>n</sup>kug¢i, with which he or she shoots at some one else. These
i<sup>n</sup>-kug¢i are small stones which are translucent and white. The members
of this society claim the power of shooting secretly any some one
with [p]éje or sidúhi, and making him lame. [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ also says that
they sometimes shoot persons secretly with "ʇama<sup>n</sup>´," which is a piece
of the intestine of a wolf, and about six inches long. This produces
fatal consequences. Frank La Flèche has heard this asserted, but it
is denied by Joseph La Flèche and Two Crows. They do not know
about the following, for which [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ is the authority: "In order
to shoot the i<sup>n</sup>-kug¢i, it is put in a hollow at the base of the eagle fan,
which is waved forward very rapidly, hurling the stone to a great distance,
about forty or fifty yards."</p>

<p>There is no special season for this dance. They dance all day, and
sometimes at night; and there are not separate places for the two sexes,
as men and women dance "íki¢ib¢a<sup>n</sup>," mixed, or intermingled.</p>

<p>Drums, rattles, etc., are used, as in the Wacicka a¢i<sup>n</sup>. Some
men wear large leggings as well as breech-cloths; but no gay clothing.
The women wear sacques, leggings, red blankets, and bead necklaces;
and they redden the parting of the hair and the cheeks somewhat as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
they do for the Wacicka a¢i<sup>n</sup>. The men wear many plumes in their
hair, and carry fans made of eagles' wings. They have no regular patterns
for painting themselves; but they use as paint either "wasejide-nika"
(Indian red) or "ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka-qude" (gray clay).</p>

<p>The only surviving leaders of this society are [T]enuga and Sihi-duba.
Among the members are B¢a<sup>n</sup>-ti, [T]and-una<sup>n</sup>ha<sup>n</sup>, Ui¢a<sup>n</sup>be-`a<sup>n</sup>sa, Cage-sk&#259;,
[T]aqiewa¢ě-jiñga, [P]a-sa<sup>n</sup>, Inigani, Maja<sup>n</sup>kide, Si-qude, N&#259;nde-wahi, and
some women. According to J. La Flèche, this is one of the dances that
are considered "waqube." It is obsolescent. B¢a<sup>n</sup>-ti, Sihi-duba, and
[T]and-una<sup>n</sup>ha<sup>n</sup> are the waze¢ě or doctors who treat biliousness and fevers;
but they do not go together to visit a patient.</p>

<p id="s257">§ 257. <i>The Buffalo dance.</i>&mdash;[T]e-í¢aé¢e-ma, <i>The society of those who have
supernatural communications with the Buffaloes, The Buffalo dancers</i>.
Four of the men of this dance are good surgeons. Two Crows' father was
a member of the society, and understood the use of the medicine, which
he transmitted to his son. Two Crows says that having inherited the
right to the medicine, he understands the duties of the doctors, but not
all about the dance, as he has paid no attention to the "ʇe i¢ae¢ě," which
has been the duty of others.</p>

<p>Until recently, the four doctors of this society were as follows: Ni-¢áctage,
the principal doctor, now dead; Two Crows (now the principal
one), [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-gahige, of the [T]a-[p]a, and Zizika-jiñga, of the Iñkesabě.
Two Crows gives portions of the medicine to the other doctors, and
they "wéze¢ě," <i>administer it to the patients</i>. A<sup>n</sup>ba-hebe used to be a
doctor. The other members whose names have been obtained are these:
Duba-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>, [T]e-uʞa<sup>n</sup>ha, Icta-q¢u`a, [T]enuga-ja<sup>n</sup>-¢iñke, I<sup>n</sup>c`age-wahi¢e,
and Gackawañg¢e. [T]ahe-jiñga, now dead, was a member.</p>

<p id="s258">§ 258. <i>Times for dancing.</i>&mdash;After the recovery of a patient, the members
of this society hold a dance, to which they may invite the members
of the Horse dance, but not those of the Wolf dance.</p>

<p>When they are not called to dance after the recovery of patients, Two
Crows says that they may dance when they please, and invite the members
of the Horse and Wolf dancing societies to join them; but the latter
can never dance independently of the Buffalo dancers.</p>

<p>[P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ says (but Two Crows denies) that "when the corn is
withering for want of rain the members of the Buffalo society have a
dance. They borrow a large vessel, which they fill with water, and put
in the center of their circle. They dance four times around it. One of
their number drinks some of the water, spurts it up into the air, making
a fine spray in imitation of a fog or misting rain. Then he knocks
over the vessel, spilling the water on the ground. The dancers then fall
down and drink up the water, getting mud all over their faces. Then
they spurt the water up into the air, making fine misting rain, which
saves the corn."<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> If this is not done by the members of the Buffalo society,
it is probably done by others, and [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ has made a mistake
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
only in the name of the society to which they belong. "The fog
occurred on the fourth day after Siqude, of the I<sup>n</sup>-kug¢i society, treated
a patient. He used to predict the fog; and the patient was caused to
walk. I never heard of the doctors, spurting water to cause the fog."

<p id="s259">§ 259. <i>Painting and dress.</i>&mdash;The men rub ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka sabě (black earth)
or ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka ʇu-qude (a greenish gray earth) over their bodies and arm-joints.
Some rub earth (ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka-sabě or ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka ʇu-qude) on the face,
from the right ear to the mouth, then from the left corner of the mouth
to the left ear. Some of the men wear only the leggings and breech-clothes;
others wear in addition to these robes with the hair outside.
Some wear buffalo tails fastened in belts. Some have sticks of red willow
with the leaves on, which they use as staffs in the dance. Each of
four men used to put the skin of a buffalo head over his head, the horns
standing up, and the hair of the buffalo head hanging down below the
chest of the wearer. It was over his forehead, as well as down his back,
but not over his eyes. He also wore a necklace of the hair that grows
on the throat of a buffalo. Two Crows says that now some wear necklaces
of "ʇéhi<sup>n</sup>," that is, the old hair, either of a bull or that of a cow,
which has been shed. Those who do not wear these ʇéhi<sup>n</sup> necklaces,
wear "ja<sup>n</sup>áqa."</p>

<p>In former days, no women participated; but now about two are present
at the feast, though they do not join in the dance. They wear robes
with the hair outside, according to [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ. No gourd rattles are
used. One man acts as "quʞa," and the rest help him. There may be
one or two drums, for which there are from two to five drummers. The
various movements of the buffalo are imitated by the dancers.</p>

<p id="s260">§ 260. <i>The Horse dance.</i>&mdash;Cañ´ge-í¢ae¢é-ma, <i>The society of those who have
supernatural communications with horses, The members of the Horse Dance</i>.</p>

<p>No women belong to this society. Two Crows says that none are
doctors, and that they never dance except in connection with the buffalo
dancers, when invited to the feast of the latter, and then they imitate
the various actions and gaits of horses. No shooting occurs as in the
dance of the Wacicka a¢i<sup>n</sup>-ma. They whiten themselves, rub earth on
their shoulders, and Indian red on some parts of their bodies. They
wear necklaces of horses' manes, from each of which a feather is suspended.
Each one wears a horse's tail in a belt. The tail is dried
stiff, and stands out from his body. At short intervals are suspended
feathers.</p>

<p><i>Members.</i>&mdash;Wacuce was a member. Those now living are G¢eda<sup>n</sup>-naji<sup>n</sup>,
Eᴐna<sup>n</sup>-hañga (who has no horses!), Wata<sup>n</sup>-naji<sup>n</sup>, Maja<sup>n</sup>-kide, Ui¢a<sup>n</sup>-be-`a<sup>n</sup>sa,
[P]a-sa<sup>n</sup>-naji<sup>n</sup>, Tcaza-¢iñge, Cyu-jiñga (who wears a necklace), Haci-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>,
Waq¢a-¢uta<sup>n</sup>, Une-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>, Waniʇa-waqě, Ta-i-kawahu, Jiñga-gahige, [K]e-baha,
etc. According to Mr. J. La Flèche, this dance is now obsolete.</p>

<p id="s261">§ 261. <i>The Wolf dance.</i>&mdash;Ca<sup>n</sup>ʇañga-í¢ae¢é-ma, <i>The society of those who
have supernatural communications with Wolves, The members of the</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
<i>Wolf Dance</i>. These men cannot dance except with the buffalo dancers,
and with the consent of the latter. Two Crows has seen them dance
but twice. He and J. La Flèche do not know much about them.</p>

<p>In this dance there are no women, and none are doctors, according to
La Flèche and Two Crows. No shooting is done, though the dancers
act mysteriously. They wear wolf skins, and redden the tips of the
wolves' noses, according to [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ and Frank La Flèche (but denied
by Two Crows). They paint their bodies in imitation of the "blue
wolves, ca<sup>n</sup>ʇañga-ʇú-ma éga<sup>n</sup>-ma-¢a<sup>n</sup>." Those who have held enemies,
or have cut them up, paint the hands and wrists red, as if they were
bloody. Others whiten their hands, wrists, ankles, and feet. Some go
barefoot. All whiten their faces from the right ear to the corner of the
mouth; then from the opposite corner of the mouth to the left ear.
They dance in imitation of the actions of wolves.</p>

<p id="s262">§ 262. <i>The Grizzly bear dance.</i>&mdash;Ma<sup>n</sup>tcú-í¢ae¢é-ma, <i>Those who have supernatural
communications with grizzly bears</i>, also called Ma<sup>n</sup>tcú-gáxe
watcígaxe, <i>The dance in which they pretend to be grizzly bears</i>. This
has not been danced for about ten years, so La Flèche and Two Crows
cannot tell who belong to the society. In former days there were women
that belonged, but in modern times none have been members.</p>

<p>This dance is spoken of by La Flèche and Two Crows as an "úckade,"
<i>a sport</i> or <i>play</i>, and an "úʇigaxe," <i>a game</i>. It is danced at any season
of the year that the members decide upon; and all the people can witness
it. During the day, it takes place out of doors, but at night it is
held in a lodge.</p>

<p>The man who receives the drum calls on others to help him, speaking
to each one by name. Then while the first man beats the drum,
the two, three, or four helpers sing and the rest dance as grizzly bears,
and imitate the movements of those animals.</p>

<p><i>Painting and dress.</i>&mdash;They make the whole body yellow, wearing no clothing
but the breech-cloth. They rub yellow clay on the backs and fronts of
their fingers and hands, and sometimes over the whole of the legs. Sometimes
they redden the whole of the legs. Some whiten themselves here
and there; some rub Indian red on themselves in spots. Some wear
very white plumes in their hair, and others wear red plumes (hi<sup>n</sup>qpé).
One man wears the skin of a grizzly bear, pushing his fingers into
the places of the claws. Some wear necklaces of grizzly bears' claws.</p>

<p id="s263">§ 263. The [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-wasabe <i>or</i> Witcitâ <i>dance</i>.&mdash;[P]á¢i<sup>n</sup>-wasábe watcígaxe
ikágekí¢ě, <i>The society of the</i> Witcitâ <i>or</i> [P]á¢i<sup>n</sup>-wasábe (Black bear Pawnees).</p>

<p>The members of this society have a medicine which they use in three
ways: they rub it on their bodies before going into battle; they rub it
on bullets to make them kill the foe, and they administer it to horses,
making them smell it when they are about to surround a buffalo herd.
If horses are weak they make them eat some of the medicine, and smell
the rest. Similar customs are found among the Pawnees and Ponkas.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<p>A man thinks, "I will boil," and he invites to a feast those who have
the medicine of the Witcitâ society. On their arrival he says, "on
such a day we will dance." Two or three men boil for the feast to be
held in connection with the dance.</p>

<p>It takes three days to prepare the candidate, and this is done secretly.
On the fourth day there is a public ceremony in an earth lodge, during
which the candidate is shot with the red medicine. Frank La Flèche
has witnessed this, and says that it closely resembles the public ceremony
of the Wacicka society.</p>

<p id="s264">§ 264. <i>Paint and dress.</i>&mdash;The breech-cloth is the only regular garment.
Two Crows and La Flèche say that all whiten their bodies and
legs all over; but [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ says that some draw white lines over
their limbs and bodies. Some paint as deer, putting white stripes on
their limbs and bodies; others appear as bald eagles, with whitened
faces. Some wear caps of the skin of the "ʇíkaqúde" or gray fox.
Some wear necklaces of the skin of that animal; and others have on
necklaces of the tail of a black-tailed deer and that of an ordinary
deer, fastened together. Some carry a "ʇikaqude" skin on the arm,
while others carry the skin of the "ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñ´kacéha," or red fox, of which
the hair is very red, and the legs and ankles are black. Some wear
feathers of the great owl around the wrist; and others carry fans made
of the feathers of that bird. "Maka<sup>n</sup>´-jide ha u¢áha baqtáqta nusi-áq¢a-hna<sup>n</sup>i"&mdash;<i>The
red medicine with the skin adhering to it</i> (being about
three inches long) <i>is tied up in a bundle, which is worn</i> "nusi-aq¢a,"
<i>like a coiled lariat, with one end over the left shoulder, and the other under
the right arm</i>.</p>

<p>Each of the four singers has a gourd rattle, a bow, and an arrow.
He holds the bow, which is whitened, in his left hand, and the rattle
and arrow in his right. He strikes the arrow against the bow-string
as he shakes the rattle.</p>

<p>All the members have whistles or flutes, some of which are a foot
long, and others are about half a yard in length. The dancers blow
theirs in imitation of the "quʞa."</p>

<p><i>Members.</i>&mdash;Only one woman belongs to this society; but the male
members are the following: G¢eda<sup>n</sup>-naji<sup>n</sup>, [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-gahige, Muxa-naji<sup>n</sup>, [T]euʞa<sup>n</sup>-ha,
Za<sup>n</sup>zi-mande, Wajiñga, [S]ni-ti¢a<sup>n</sup>, Qi¢a-gahige, [T]enuga-ja<sup>n</sup>-¢iñke,
Zizika-jiñga, [K]axe-na<sup>n</sup>p'i<sup>n</sup>, Cage-duba, Eᴐna<sup>n</sup>-hañga, Ag¢i<sup>n</sup>-duba, Jiñga-gahige,
and Waji<sup>n</sup>-¢icage.</p>

<p>The members of this society would eat no green corn, fruit, etc., till
consecrated by the dance. A few ears of corn were divided among the
dancers. Then they could eat as they pleased.</p>

<p id="s265">§ 265. Watcí-wa¢upí.&mdash;This society has not had a dance for about
thirty years among the Omahas. It is like the dance of the Wasejide
a¢i<sup>n</sup>ma, which has a medicine that resembles that of the [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-wasabe
in its use. During the day women danced with the men; but at night
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
the men danced alone. This is said to be one of the ancient tribal
dances.</p>

<p id="s266">§ 266. Wasé-jíde a¢i<sup>n</sup>´-ma, <i>Those who have the Red Paint or Medicine</i>.&mdash;This
is a society of women dancers. They seldom meet. Their dance
is like that of the Watci-wa¢upi. [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ says that the dance is
sacred. La Flèche and Two Crows have never seen it. They invite the
members to a feast, as do the Wacicka a¢i<sup>n</sup>-ma; but no shooting is done.
The men act as singers, while the women dance. All the women are
allowed to join in this dance, which is held when the grass is green in
the spring. Sometimes a man joins in the dance, but that is the exception.
[Frank La Flèche says that men do take part in this dance,
and that the women do not carry the medicine.]<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>This society has a medicine consisting of the bottoms of several joints
or stalks of a certain kind of grass, which are tied up in bundles. One
man carries a bundle in his belt, and the rest are put in a safe place.
This is the medicine, according to [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ, which warriors carry.
If they meet an enemy they open the bundles and rub the medicine over
their bodies to protect them from the missiles of the enemy. They think
that this medicine will cause the enemy's guns to miss fire, or else the
balls, when sent, will not hit them. The only painting is red, which is
on the cheeks, chin, and chest of the dancer. A line is drawn from
each corner of the mouth back to the cheek, and there is one made
from the lower lip down under the chin, and it is continued down the
chest until it is about as low as the heart.</p>

<p id="s267">§ 267. The Ha<sup>n</sup>´he watcí ([T]ᴐiwere, Ha<sup>n</sup>´he wací) is not "The
Night Dance," as its name implies. It is an ancient dance, which is
not used now. According to [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ, it is "qubé áta," <i>very
sacred</i> (for persons), and it is danced in the later fall, when the people
have killed a great many deer, or many of the enemy. Two Crows and
La Flèche say that it is "úwahéhajĭ, núaʇá¢ica<sup>n</sup>, <i>a bravery dance, pertaining
to men</i>;" but they do not know all the particulars. During the
day women danced, and the men sang for them. Occasionally a man
joined in the dance. At night the men danced alone. But only those
who had been captains, or had killed foes, or had brought back horses,
or had been warriors, had a right to take part in the dance.</p>

<p>Mr. J. La Flèche said that there was some connection between this
society and the Iñg¢a<sup>n</sup>-i¢ae¢e-ma.</p>

<p>The Héde-watcí was a "nikie dance," which occurred on a festival,
and in which the whole tribe participated. (See § <a href="#s153">153</a>.)</p>

<p>The Wé-watci, or Scalp dance, is the women's dance, in which all join
who may so desire. (See War Customs, § <a href="#s215">215</a>.)</p>

<p>The Míʞasi watcí, or Coyote dance, is described in the chapter on
War Customs, § <a href="#s203">203</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

<p>The He¢úcka dancing society is described in the chapter on War
Customs, §§ <a href="#s214">214</a>, <a href="#s216">216</a>.</p>

<p>The Hé watci is part of the He¢ucka dance. (§ <a href="#s217">217</a>.)</p>

<p id="s268">§ 268. T'é gáxe watcí, <i>The dance of those expecting to die</i>.&mdash;This has
not been observed for fifteen years by the Omahas. It is explained
thus, "Ukít`ě ʞĭctě, at'é támiñke, e¢éga<sup>n</sup> éga<sup>n</sup> úwatcigáxe gáxai."&mdash;<i>As
one thinks, 'I will die if there are any enemy,' they make the dance.</i></p>

<p>This is the men's dance, being "wacuce-aʇá¢ica<sup>n</sup>," <i>i. e.</i>, something
pertaining to bravery. They always go prepared to meet the enemy
and to fall in battle. It is danced at different seasons of the year. A
woman with a good voice is admitted as a singer. Two or three beat
a drum. Two men carry "waq¢éq¢e-`a<sup>n</sup>sá" in their hands as they dance.
These objects resemble the "waq¢éxe-¢áze," but there is a different
arrangement of the feathers.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span>&mdash;The waq¢éq¢e-`a<sup>n</sup>sa.</p>
</div>

<p>All paint themselves as they please, and carry "ʇahánuʞa [p]éxe" or
rattles made of green hide.</p>

<p id="s269">§ 269. <i>The Make-no-fight dance.</i>&mdash;Má¢a wátcigáxe, the "Napé-śníkaǵápi"
of the Dakotas, has not been witnessed among the Omahas for
many years, though it used to be common to the Omahas, Ponkas, and
Dakotas. La Flèche and Two Crows have heard of it, but have not
seen it. [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ says "I have not seen it since I have been grown.
It was in use here long before my time." It is a bravery dance.
Drums are beaten. The dancers hold gourd rattles, and each one carries
many arrows on his back as well as in his arms. The members vow
not to flee from a foe. They blacken themselves all over with charcoal.
About fifty years ago two members went into a fight armed only
with deer's claw rattles that had sharp iron points at the ends of the handles.
They rushed among the foe and stabbed them before they could
draw their bows.</p>

<p id="s270">§ 270. [P]a-ug¢a<sup>n</sup> Watcí, <i>The dance in which buffalo head-dresses were
put on</i>, has long been obsolete. It was a bravery dance. [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ
knew about its occurring once when he was very small. Only very
brave men could participate. On their heads they put head-dresses to
which buffalo horns were attached. They bore shields on their backs;
they rubbed earth on themselves. Any one who had stabbed a foe with
a spear carried it on his arm; and he who had struck a foe with any
weapon did likewise. Those who were only a little brave could not
dance.</p>

<p id="s271">§ 271. Égi`a<sup>n</sup>-wátcigáxe, <i>The Visitors' dance of relating exploits</i>.&mdash;When
a friendly visit has been made horses are given to all the visitors who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
are invited to dance. "Égi`a<sup>n</sup> wa¢átcigáxe tai," <i>You will dance the dance
of exploits</i>. The visitors sit in a circle and the members of the home
tribe sit outside. A drum, stick, a "crow," and a club or hatchet are
placed inside the circle. There is no singing. When the drum is struck
one of the visitors dances. He who has something to tell about himself
takes the crow and attaches it to his belt. Then he takes the club or
hatchet. When the drummers beat faster all of them say, "Hĭ! hĭ! hĭ!"
When they stop beating the dancer tells what he has done. Pointing
in one direction with his club or hatchet he says, "In that place I killed
a man." Pointing elsewhere, he says, "There I took hold of a man."
"I brought back so many horses from that tribe." Sometimes they beat
the drum again before he finishes telling his exploits. Sometimes a
man recounts much about himself, if very brave, taking four such intervals
to complete his part of the performance. When he has finished he
hands the crow and weapon to the next dancer. There are four dancers
in all. Some tell their exploits two or three times, <i>i. e.</i>, they may require
two or three intervals or spaces of time after the beating of the
drum to tell all that they have to say. When the fourth dancer stops
the dance is over. (See the He watci, at the end of the He¢ucka dance,
§ <a href="#s217">217</a>.) This is not danced very often.</p>

<p id="s272">§ 272. <i>The Ghost dance.</i>&mdash;Wanáxe-í¢ae¢é-ma are those who have supernatural
communications with ghosts. The dance is called Wanáxe
í¢aé¢e wátcigáxe. Formerly the Ponkas had this dance, and the Omahas
saw it and coveted it; so they took it. It has not been danced by
the Omahas for about forty years. La Flèche and Two Crows never saw
it, but they have heard of it; and they speak of it as "úqtajĭ edáda<sup>n</sup>
ígaxewa¢ájĭ," <i>undesirable; totally unfit for any use</i>. But [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ
says that it was an "úwaqube," <i>a sacred thing</i>. No women participated.
A feast was called, the men assembled, a drum was struck, and they
danced. The dancers made their bodies gray, and called themselves
ghosts.</p>

<p id="s273">§ 273. <i>The Padanka dance.</i>&mdash;The Pádañka watcí (Camanche dance?) has
not been held among the Omahas since [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-na<sup>n</sup>pajĭ can remember.
The Omahas bought it from another tribe, and had it a long time.
When Mr. J. La Flèche was small, he saw a little of it. He and Two
Crows have heard about it. The drum was struck; the dancers reddened
their bodies with Indian red; they wore head-dresses of crow
feathers or of the large feathers of the great owl. Bach one carried
the "ʇacáge" or rattles of deers' claws.</p>

<p id="s274">§ 274. <i>The Hekána dance.</i>&mdash;This was introduced among the Omahas by
the Otos when they visited the former tribe in August, 1878. The Otos
call it "He-ka<sup>n</sup>´-yu-há." It is found among the Sacs and other Indians
south of the Omahas. This is the dance in which the young people of
both sexes participate, and it is called "úmi<sup>n</sup>¢íg¢a<sup>n</sup>," as it leads the
young men to think of courting the girls.</p>

<p>When a young man wishes to have a chance for saying something to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
a girl whom he admires he boils for a feast, and invites the guests.
All the young men assemble, and the unmarried girls and boys attend,
though the girls never go without a proper escort. Mothers take their
daughters, and husbands go with their wives.</p>

<p>The dance is held in a large earth-lodge, in the middle of which a fire
is kept up, and candles are placed on supports around the walls. Sometimes
the boys blow out the lights all at once after a preconcerted
signal, and great confusion ensues. All wear their gayest clothing and
plenty of ornaments. Fine ribbon is worn on clothing, hats, etc.</p>

<p>When a youth wishes to court a girl, he waits till the girl approaches
him in the dance. Then he takes her by the hands, and dances facing
her. As there is great confusion, no one else can hear him addressing
her, his face being very close to hers. Every time the drumming stops,
the dancers in each pair change places, but they still face each other.</p>

<p>When a woman or girl wishes a man as a partner, she takes him by
the hands when he gets close to her in the dance.</p>

<p>When a distant "mother's brother" meets one whom he calls his
niece, he may address her thus in sport: "A<sup>n</sup>wátcigaxe taí, wihé!" <i>i. e.</i>,
"Second daughter of the family, let us dance." She replies, "Give me
pay." So he makes her a present of a necklace or of some other ornament,
and she dances with him. A real uncle never acts thus.</p>

<p>Sometimes when a girl spies among the spectators an aged man who
is a kinsman, she will rush to him in sport, take him by the hands, pull
him to his feet, and make him dance with her. On the other hand, when
a young man spies an aged female relative looking on, he may rush to
her, in sport, and pull her into the ring making her dance with him.</p>

<p>There is a feast after the dance. If there is but a small supply of
food only the women and girls eat; but if there is plenty, the men wait
till the others have eaten awhile, then they partake. After the feast
the guests go home; but they sleep nearly all of the following day, as
they are very tired.</p>

<p id="s275">§ 275. <i>The Mandan dance.</i>&mdash;The Ponkas obtained this dance from the
Dakotas and the Omahas learned it from the Ponkas. None but aged
men and those in the prime of life belong to this society. All are expected
to behave themselves, to be sober, and refrain from quarreling
and fighting among themselves. (For an account of one of their feasts,
see § <a href="#s111">111</a>.)</p>

<p>This dance is celebrated as a bravery dance over the bodies of any
warriors who have been slain by the enemy. Each body is placed in a
sitting posture in the lodge, as if alive, and with a rattle of deers' claws
fastened to one arm. (See Contributions to N. A. Ethnology, Vol.
VI, Part I, pp. 431, 452.) This dance has been obsolete for some time
among the Omahas. It was danced in 1853. (See § <a href="#s218">218</a>.)</p>

<p id="s276">§ 276. <i>The Tukála dance</i> was obtained from the Dakotas by the Ponkas,
who taught it to the Omahas. This dance is for boys what the Mandan
dance is for aged men and men in the prime of life. Its rules resemble
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
those of the other dance, but the songs and dances are different. The
behavior of the members is not as good as that of the members of the
Mandan society, though quarreling is forbidden. This is a bravery
dance. Two women attend as singers. Two men who do not fear death
are the leaders in the dance. Each one carries a "wahékuzi" or "waq¢éxe-¢áze",
of which the end feather on the bent part of the pole is white,
and the pole is wrapped in a piece of otter skin.</p>

<p id="s277">§ 277. <i>The Sun dance</i> has not been practiced among the Omahas. They
can give no account of it, though some of the ceremonies of the Hede-watci,
such as the procession to the place for felling the tree, the race
for the tree, the felling of the tree, the manner in which it is carried to
the village, and the preparation of the "ujéʇi," agree very remarkably
with the account of the Sun dance read by Miss A. C. Fletcher before
the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in August,
1882. The Ponkas obtained this dance from the Dakotas.</p>

<p id="s278">§ 278. The "Waná wátcigáxe," or <i>Begging dance</i>, is not found among
the Omahas; but among the Ponkas, Dakotas, etc., the members of any
dancing society do dance at times in order to get presents.</p>

<p id="s279">§ 279. <i>Ponka dancing societies.</i>&mdash;The Ponka men have two other dancing
societies: the Gak'éxe (which the Omaha Duba-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup> says is the
same as the Hi<sup>n</sup>ská-yuhá of the Dakotas) and the ₵adúxe. No information
has been gained respecting these societies.</p>

<small>REGULATIVE INDUSTRIES.</small></h2>

<h3 id="THE_GOVERNMENT">THE GOVERNMENT.</h3>

<p id="s280">§ 280. Regulative industries are such as pertain to the government of
the tribe, embracing all organizations which are "wewaspeaʇa¢ica<sup>n</sup>," <i>i. e.</i>,
such as are designed to make the people behave themselves.</p>

<p>Everything that can be thus used is a "wewaspe." Among the former
are the gentile system (Chap. III), religion, and government, with the
last of which is associated the law. With the latter may be classed the
sacred tents, sacred pipes, chiefs, etc. A term of broader significance
is "Wakandaʇa¢ica<sup>n</sup>," <i>Pertaining to</i> or <i>derived from Wakanda</i>, the Deity
or Superior Being. Most of the things which are wewaspeaʇa¢ica<sup>n</sup> are
also Wakandaʇa¢ica<sup>n</sup>, but there are things which are Wakandaʇa¢ica<sup>n</sup>
that are not directly connected with the government of the state, <i>e. g.</i>,
the law of catamenial seclusion.</p>

<p id="s281">§ 281. <i>Governmental instrumentalities.</i>&mdash;The following wewaspe or
government instrumentalities are regarded as Wakandaʇa¢ica<sup>n</sup>: The
sacred pipes, including the war pipe, the calumet pipes, the sacred pole,
the sacred ʇe-sa<sup>n</sup>-ha, or hide of a white buffalo; the clam shell, the chiefs,
the keepers of the three sacred tents, the seven keepers of the sacred
pipes, the gentes, subgentes, and taboos. The following are considered
of human origin: The policemen and the feasting societies. "The way
to a man's heart is through his stomach" is a familiar saying. So feasting
societies tend to promote the peace of the community, as those who
eat together, or give food to one another, are bound together as friends.
(See § <a href="#s246">246</a>.)</p>

<p id="s282">§ 282. <i>Government functions.</i>&mdash;Government functions are of three
classes: legislative, executive, and judicial; but these are not fully differentiated
in the Omaha state. There is a still further functional
division running through the legislative, executive, and judicial departments,
giving civil, military, and religious government. Among the
Omahas civil and religious government are scarcely differentiated;
but military government is almost entirely so. (See War Customs,
Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">IX</a>.)</p>

<p id="s283">§ 283. There does not seem to be a distinct order of priests who perform
all religious functions. Some of these functions are performed by
the regular chiefs, others by the keepers of the sacred pipes, others by
the four wa¢a<sup>n</sup> during the buffalo hunt, and others by the leaders of the
dances. Conjurors also pretend to perform mysterious or sacred rites.
At the same time, the functions thus performed by the chiefs, keepers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
of the sacred pipes, and the wa¢a<sup>n</sup> are of a civil character. The chiefs
are religions officers during the buffalo hunt; they are always praying
to Wakanda, and showing the pipes to him. They do not act as leaders
of the hunt, which is the office of the wa¢a<sup>n</sup>, though they can make
suggestions to the latter. They cannot draw their robes tightly around
them, when they are thus praying, and they must be sober and gentle.</p>

<p>The keepers of the sacred pipes are regarded as chiefs in some sense,
though they are not allowed to speak in the tribal assembly. "Each
chief is a member of the tribal assembly, though he is not a chief by
virtue of such membership, but by choice of the members of his gens."
While the chieftainship is not hereditary, each chief tries to have one
of his near kinsmen elected as his successor.</p>

<p id="s284">§ 284. <i>Head chiefs.</i>&mdash;Those of the highest grade are the "nikagahi
uju," or principal chiefs. There have always been two of this rank
among the Omahas till the late change of the government in 1880. The
head chiefs have generally been chosen from the Hañgacenu gentes,
though there is no law forbidding the selection of a member of one of
the Ictasanda gentes.</p>

<p>The following is the succession of the principal chiefs of the Omahas
from the time of the celebrated Black Bird:</p>

<p>I. Gahige-ʇañga, The Elder Gahige, commonly called Wajiñga-sabe,
Black Bird, of the Ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka-gaxe (an Ictasanda) gens; and [T]e-sa<sup>n</sup> i<sup>n</sup>c`age,
The Elder [T]e-sa<sup>n</sup>, or The Venerable man, Distant-white Buffalo,
of the ₵atada (Hañgacenu) gens. II. [T]e-sa<sup>n</sup> i<sup>n</sup>c`age (<i>continued</i>), and
A<sup>n</sup>pa<sup>n</sup>-sk&#259;, White Elk, of the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte (a Hañgacenu) gens. III. [T]e-sa<sup>n</sup>
i<sup>n</sup>c`age (<i>continued</i>), and A<sup>n</sup>pa<sup>n</sup>-ʇañga, Big Elk, of the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte gens,
subsequently known by his Pawnee name, Ta-i´-ki-ta´-wa-hu. This was
the celebrated Big Elk mentioned by Long, Say, and others in 1819-'20.
IV. Taikitawahu, and Úha<sup>n</sup>-jiñga or Waháxi, called Icta-ʇañga, Big
Eyes, by the white men. The latter was an Ictasanda man. He married
a sister of G¢eda<sup>n</sup>-naji<sup>n</sup>, and this was one reason why the latter
succeeded him as one of the principal chiefs. V. In 1843, A<sup>n</sup>pa<sup>n</sup>-ʇañga
jiñga, the Younger Big Elk, of the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte gens, and G¢eda<sup>n</sup>-naji<sup>n</sup>,
Standing Hawk, of the ₵atada gens. Another reason for the appointment
of the latter was the friendship existing between his father, [T]e-sa<sup>n</sup>,
and Taikitawahu. VI. On the death of A<sup>n</sup>pa<sup>n</sup>-ʇañga, his adopted
son, Icta-ma<sup>n</sup>zě, Iron Eyes, or Joseph La Flèche, was made his successor,
and so he and G¢eda<sup>n</sup>-naji<sup>n</sup> were the principal chiefs till the
former was set aside. Since then there has been confusion about the
head chieftainship, as well as about the chieftainship in general, ending
in the election of seven chiefs of equal rank in 1880.</p>

<p id="s285">§ 285. <i>Subordinate chiefs.</i>&mdash;Next to the nikagahi uju are the under
chiefs, or nikagahi, of whom the number in each tribe varies from time
to time. When both of the head chiefs retire from office or die there
is an entire change of the subordinate chiefs; all must resign, and others
must be elected to fill their places. Thus when A<sup>n</sup>pa<sup>n</sup>-ʇañga jiñga and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
G¢eda<sup>n</sup>-naji<sup>n</sup> succeeded to the head chieftainship, in 1843, fully sixty
subordinate chiefs were appointed. Among these were A<sup>n</sup>ba-hebe, of
the [T]a-[p]a gens; Icta-duba, of the Wasabe-hit`ajĭ subgens; [P]asi-duba
and Za<sup>n</sup>zi-mandě, of the [K]a<sup>n</sup>ze gens; Ta<sup>n</sup>wa<sup>n</sup>-gaxe, of the Ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka-gaxe
gens; and [P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-gahige, of the [T]a-[p]a. Some chiefs have been appointed
by the United States Government, and so have been recognized
as chiefs by the United States agent in his councils with the tribe; but
these are distinct from the regular chiefs. In 1878 the writer found
three of this kind of chiefs among the Omahas. They had been appointed
by the United States about the year 1869. Cañge-sk&#259; was made
chief in the place of Ta<sup>n</sup>wa<sup>n</sup>-gaxe; Ibaha<sup>n</sup>bi, instead of his father,
Wanuʞige, of the Ictasanda gens; and Waniʇa-waqě, the keeper of the
sacred pipe of the [T]a-[p]a was the third.</p>

<p>In 1878 the following were the chiefs who met the agent in councils:
G¢eda<sup>n</sup>-naji<sup>n</sup> and his brother, [P]ede-gahi, who were considered the head
chiefs by some; Ma<sup>n</sup>tcu-na<sup>n</sup>ba, of the Hañga; Gahige, of the Iñke-sabě;
Mahi<sup>n</sup>-¢iñge, of the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte; Wacka<sup>n</sup>-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>, the third ₵atada chief;
Cañge-sk&#259;, Waniʇa-waqě, and Ibaha<sup>n</sup>bi. The last three always appeared
to stand together, forming a third party in the tribe, as opposed
to the chiefs' party (to which the others belonged), and that of the
young men or progressives.</p>

<p id="s286">§ 286. <i>Omaha chiefs elected in March, 1880.</i>&mdash;These were elected by an
assembly of the whole tribe, in open council, and by a show of hands.
All are of equal rank, there being no principal chiefs:</p>

<p>[P]ede-gahi (of the chiefs' party) and Na<sup>n</sup>pewa¢ě or Cyu-jiñga (of the
young men's party), of the ₵atada (G¢eda<sup>n</sup>-naji<sup>n</sup> and Wacka<sup>n</sup>-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup> were
deposed). Gahige (of the chiefs' party) and Duba-ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup> (of the young
men's party), of the Iñke-sabě. [K]axe-¢a<sup>n</sup>ba, or Two Crows (of the young
men's party), and Icta-basude (of the chiefs' party), of the Hañga. The
latter was substituted for his aged father, Ma<sup>n</sup>tcu-na<sup>n</sup>ba. The only
Ictasanda chief elected was Cañge-sk&#259;, of the Ma<sup>n</sup>¢iñka-gaxe. Mahi<sup>n</sup>-¢iñge,
Waniʇawaqě, and Ibaha<sup>n</sup>bi were ignored.</p>

<p>A few months later three more were elected: Sĭnde-xa<sup>n</sup>xa<sup>n</sup> instead of
Waniʇa-waqě, of the [T]a-[p]a; Waha<sup>n</sup>-¢iñge, of the [T]e-sĭnde; and Ibaha<sup>n</sup>bi,
of the Ictasanda, making ten chiefs.</p>

<p id="s287">§ 287. <i>Keepers of the sacred pipes.</i>&mdash;These have been chiefs among the
Ponkas, and it seems probable that they are reckoned as such among
the Omahas. (See the account of the inauguration of Ponka chiefs,
§ <a href="#s289">289</a>.)</p>

<p>Though no council could be opened without their assistance, they
were not allowed to take part in any of the deliberations. (See § <a href="#s296">296</a>.)</p>

<p id="s288">§ 288. <i>Who can be elected chiefs.</i>&mdash;As a rule, they must be such as
have won a good reputation in the tribe. A generous man, one who
has given more presents or feasts than his kinsmen, stands a chance
of being elected a chief by and by. The presents, however, must be
made to the poor and aged, of those who are not kinsmen. Sometimes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
a man is elected who has not led a good life; but they make him
chief with the hope that the new responsibilities resting on him may
sober him, and make him a wise man. Sometimes a man succeeds to
the chieftainship through the efforts of some kinsman or affinity who
is a chief or head chief.</p>

<p><i>Occasions of such elections.</i>&mdash;The resignation or death of one of the
principal chiefs; the resignation of both of the principal chiefs, or the
resignation of one and the death of the other.</p>

<p id="s289">§ 289. <i>Sacred or mysterious rites pertaining to the initiation or inauguration
of chiefs.</i>&mdash;(1). Among the Ponkas. Ma<sup>n</sup>`egahi, of the Hisada, told
the following: Muxa-naji<sup>n</sup> of the Wacabe, Ce-naji<sup>n</sup> of the Maka<sup>n</sup>, ₵a`ega<sup>n</sup>
of the Nuqe, Si-¢iñge of the Maka<sup>n</sup>, Ma<sup>n</sup>ze-si-ugada<sup>n</sup> (of the half-breed
band), and Canugahi of the ₵ixida, carry the six sacred pipes four times
around the tribal circle. Muxa-naji<sup>n</sup> puts up a large tent (in the middle
of the circle), unwraps the bundle containing the six pipes, and then the
five other men accompany him around the circle.</p>

<p>The sacred pipes are feared by all except those who are to be made
chiefs, sometimes four, five, or six men. These are outside (of their
lodges), and as the old men come around, if they have agreed to become
chiefs, they put the pipe-stems to their mouths, but they do not
inhale any of the smoke. When the old men have gone around the
fourth time the chiefs assemble in the large tent. The women and
children stay outside or back of the circle, as they are afraid of the
pipes. Even the horses are sent to the rear. When the chiefs elect
enter the large tent they give many horses to the retiring chiefs.
Then they put the pipes to their mouths
and inhale the smoke, for if they should
refuse to inhale it, they would die very
soon thereafter, before the end of the
year.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span>&mdash;The Ponka style of
hañga-ʞi`a<sup>n</sup>ze.</p>
</div>

<p>Nuda<sup>n</sup>-axa's account of the ceremonies
at the time of his election is as follows:
When an old chief resigns, a tent is set up
in the middle of the circle. They bring
back some wild sage, which is used as a
bed for the sacred pipes. These are laid
on the wild sage in the middle of the tent,
next to the sacred buffalo skull. The
hañga-ʞi`a<sup>n</sup>ze or privileged decoration is
painted on the skull, into the nostrils of
which some sprigs of wild sage are thrust.
All the chiefs paint the hañga-ʞi`a<sup>n</sup>ze on
their faces, and stick plumes in their hair. They wear buffalo robes with
the hair outside, and redden their arm-pits, elbows, and the toes of their
moccasins. They redden blankets at the elbows and next to the arm-pits,
in imitation of the buffaloes. The retiring chiefs say to their successors,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
"Qubéʞi¢ái-g&#259;!" <i>i. e.</i>, "Cause yourselves to be sacred by means of the animals
that you see in your dreams when you fast." When they have left
the large tent, and have returned to their respective lodges, they sit with
their robes over their heads, and before they leave their lodges again,
they must make new tent-flaps, which is a sacred act. The bearers of
the sacred pipes are Ce-naji<sup>n</sup> of the Maka<sup>n</sup>, He¢icije of the Nuqe,
[P]a¢i<sup>n</sup>-gahige (of the Wajaje?), Muxa-naji<sup>n</sup> of the Wacabe, a Nika[p]aᴐna
man, and Canugahi of the ₵ixida. As the old men reach the tents of
each gens it is announced by some of the spectators, "They have
reached the Nuqe!" for example. When Cenaji<sup>n</sup> arrives at the tents of
each gens, he says, "Ho! I have come to you." The pipes are handed
in succession to the candidate who sits at the end. Muxa-naji<sup>n</sup> addresses
a few words to each of the candidates who are not the sons of
chiefs, but to those who are the sons of chiefs many words are spoken.
I belonged to this latter class, so all the old men said to me, "Níʇa
í¢ib¢a<sup>n</sup> taté! I<sup>n</sup>c`áge cí taté! ₵iádi gáhi, ¢iji<sup>n</sup>´¢e gáhi, ¢iʇíga<sup>n</sup> gáhi,
ámustáqti ¢ida<sup>n</sup>´bema<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>´taí! Wágazuqti ma<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>´ ga<sup>n</sup>´¢a-g&#259;." i. e., "You
shall have your fill of life! You shall live to be an aged man! Your
father was a chief, your elder brother was a chief, and your grandfather
was a chief; may they continue to look directly down on you! Desire thou
to walk very honestly." At length they say, "Ca<sup>n</sup>," <i>Enough!</i> Then the
crier proclaims, "Ca<sup>n</sup>´ á¢a, u+!" <i>i. e.</i>, "It is indeed enough, halloo!"
Then all the people walk rapidly to the tent in the middle of the circle,
each one trying to get there before the others so as to get a good seat.
So they reach there and pass around the tent. At the time of my inauguration
I sat at the door of the large tent. Those who had no seats within,
(<i>i. e.</i>, as chiefs) sat outside. They were addressed thus: "Gí¢iʞa<sup>n</sup>
ité¢a-g&#259;! Égi¢e ě´di ¢ag¢i<sup>n</sup>´ te h&#259;!" <i>i. e.</i>, "Make room! Beware how you
sit there!" By and by the two principal chiefs came, stepping very deliberately,
and took their places at the head of the circle of those within
the large tent.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Among the Omahas</i>, as told by La Flèche and Two Crows:</p>

<p>Only one old man goes once around the tribal circle. He starts from
his own gens, the Iñke-sabě, and enters but a single tent of each gens.
He tells the people of that gens to question all their fellow <i>gentiles</i> who
wish to be chiefs. The old man enters the Weji<sup>n</sup>cte tent last of all.
The men of each gens assemble by themselves. Some are afraid to undertake
the chieftainship, saying, "It is difficult; I am unwilling." If
a candidate is "naxíde-¢iñ´ge," or "wáspajĭ," <i>i. e.</i>, <i>disobedient</i> or <i>ill-behaved</i>,
the men of his gens can prevent his acceptance of the office. The
next day the chiefs assemble in a large tent. The decorations of the
chiefs, the disposition of the sacred pipes and buffalo skull are similar
to what happens among the Ponkas, with a few exceptions. The chiefs
do not redden their arm-pits, elbows, and the toes of their moccasins,
and the hañga-ʞi`a<sup>n</sup>ze is slightly different.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span></p>

<p>The only clothing worn by the chiefs during this ceremony consists of
moccasins, leggings, breech-cloths, and buffalo robes, with the hair outside.
The place of meeting is the earth-lodge
belonging to one of the principal chiefs. Besides
the chiefs, only a few very brave men
are admitted to witness the ceremony and to
act as servants. The keepers of the sacred
pipes are there; and the two old men of the
Hañga who keep the sacred tents, sit by the
door, as the wag¢a, to get wood and water,
and to attend to the boiling of the food for
the feast. The rest of the people, including
the brave men and the young men, are not
invited to the feast, but they can sit outside
the lodge. When the crier says, "Ca<sup>n</sup>a¢a,
u+!" the candidates know that he refers to
them, so they and the people hasten to the
earth-lodge. (See Fig. 2, § <a href="#s18">18</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span>&mdash;The Omaha style of hañga-ʞi`a<sup>n</sup>ze.</p>
</div>

<p>The brave young men may be selected from
each gens to hand around the food; and one of the principal chiefs calls
on two by name to lade out the food.</p>

<p>The principal chief who is about to retire tells each new chief where
he must sit in the circle of chiefs, and to whatever place he is thus assigned
he must regard that as his seat in the assembly from that time
on. The seat in question is resigned to the new chief by one of the retiring
chiefs, except when some of the subordinate chiefs vacate their
places to move nearer to the head chiefs, in which case the new chiefs
are told to take the places thus vacated.</p>

<p>When one of the head chiefs resigns all of the subordinate chiefs
change their places in the council, moving nearer to the seats of the
principal chiefs. But should the principal chiefs so desire it some of the
new chiefs may occupy the seats near them, being promoted over some
of the subordinates. A new chief did not always succeed a retiring chief
of the same gens.</p>

<p>The retiring head chief then exhorts each new chief thus: "If you
get in a bad humor Wakanda will do so to you. Do not lie lest the
people speak of you as lying chiefs and refuse to obey you."</p>

<p id="s290">§ 290. <i>The tribal assembly or council.</i>&mdash;This is composed of the chiefs
alone. The common people have no voice in it. When there is any
very important business the young men and all the people are informed
of it after the meeting of the council. When the chiefs are thus assembled,
they are not always invited to a feast; but the two sacred pipes
were always carried around the circle. (See § <a href="#s18">18</a>.)</p>

<p>The principal chiefs did not act without consulting the other chiefs.
They used to call them together and submit to them any important
questions that had arisen, saying first to one then to another, "What
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
do you decide on?" or "Do you decide what shall be done." If one
after another refused to express an opinion, the two principal chiefs continued
their questioning till they found one who gave a decision.</p>

<p id="s291">§ 291. <i>The Gentile Assembly.</i>&mdash;A gens could assemble as a whole when
there was any special occasion for such action, <i>e. g.</i>, if they had any
grievance against the members of another gens.</p>

<p id="s292">§ 292. <i>Powers of subordinate Chiefs.</i>&mdash;Chiefs had certain rights, among
which were the following: 1. The right to sit in the tribal assembly, and
to join in the deliberations. 2. The right of each to retain his office till
his death or resignation. 3. The right to regulate the buffalo hunt with
the aid of the directors and the keepers of the Hañga sacred tents. 4.
The right to approve or disapprove of the organization of a small war
party, and to prevent the departure of the same. 5. The right to form
a party to go on a friendly visit to another tribe; this includes the right
to go with a sacred pipe to the village or camp of a hostile tribe in order
to make peace. 6. The right to stop quarreling or fighting between two
or more persons, by putting the two sacred pipes between the combatants
and begging them to desist. 7. The right to assemble at the sacred
tent of the Elk gens, and regulate the sending out of scouts in case of
a sudden alarm. 8. In modern times, the chiefs have exercised the right
to sell all or a portion of the land occupied by the tribe, to the United
States Government; but such a right was, from the nature of the case,
unknown in ancient times.</p>

<p>No chief had a right to interfere with the food or other property of
private individuals, such as that belonging to the head of a household.
So when visitors came from another tribe the chiefs could not compel
members of their tribe to entertain them or make presents to them; all
they could do was to ask such things of the people as favors. No chief
had a right to deprive a hunter of an animal that he had killed, nor
could he claim even a part of the animal. (See § <a href="#s147">147</a>.)</p>

<p id="s293">§ 293. <i>Powers of principal Chiefs.</i>&mdash;Among their powers are the following:
1. The right to order the policemen to strike the disobedient.
2. The right to order the crier to proclaim the decisions of the tribal
assembly. 3. The right to call on two of the brave young men by name,
and tell them to lade out the food for the feast. 4. The right to the
principal seats in the tribal assembly. 5. The right of one of them to
determine the place for each newly-elected chief in the tribal assembly,
and also to give any chief a higher place in the circle, promoting him
to a place above some of his seniors.</p>

<p id="s294">§ 294. <i>Deposition of Chiefs.</i>&mdash;Chiefs were not deposed. They always
continued in office till their deaths or resignations. But when both
head chiefs died, or one died and the other resigned, all the subordinate
chiefs were obliged to resign.</p>

<p id="s295">§ 295. <i>Powers of the Keepers of the Sacred Tents.</i>&mdash;They had certain
duties to perform during the buffalo hunt. They had the care of the
sacred tents, with their contents, the pole, and sacred skin. They acted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
as wag¢a for the tribal assembly, in which they had seats, but without
the right to join in the deliberations. They were expected on such occasions
to attend to the fire, to bring in wood and water, and to superintend
the boiling of the food for the feast, whenever one was given to
the assembly. (See § <a href="#s8">8</a>.)</p>

<p id="s296">§ 296.&mdash;<i>Powers of the Keepers of the Sacred Pipes</i> (see Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_III">III</a>).&mdash;They
could not join in the deliberation of the tribal assembly, though
no council could be opened without their assistance. (See § <a href="#s287">287</a>.)</p>

<p id="s297">§ 297. <i>Powers of the Policemen.</i>&mdash;When not traveling on the buffalo
hunt they acted as messengers for the chiefs. There were no special policemen
for each chief. They could strike any of the disobedient persons,
even when not ordered to do so by the principal chiefs. Such
disobedient ones were those who quarreled and fought, stole, or scared
off the buffalo.</p>

<p id="s298">§ 298. <i>Religion.</i>&mdash;Religion may be considered as not fully differentiated
from the government (see §§ <a href="#s280">280</a> to <a href="#s283">283></a>). The chiefs are the religious
as well as the civil rulers of the state. A full account of the religion
of the Omahas cannot be given in this paper. It is connected with the
practice of medicine, mythology, war customs, gentile system, etc.

<small>THE LAW.</small></h2>

<p id="s299">§ 299. The law, which is the body of rules that the State endeavors
directly or indirectly to enforce, may be properly classed as follows:
1. Personal law. 2. Property law. 3. Corporation law. 4. Government
law. 5. International law. 6. Military law. 7. Religious law.</p>

<p>Crimes may be committed against personal law, property law, corporation
law, government law, international law, military law, and religious
law. So there are as many divisions of criminal law.</p>

<p id="s300">§ 300. A large part of personal law belongs to gentile or family law.
Certain degrees of consanguinity and affinity are considered as bars to
intermarriage. The marriage of kindred has always been regarded as
incestuous by the Omahas and kindred tribes. Affinities were forbidden
to Self in certain places which are explained in the description of the
kinship system and the marriage laws.</p>

<p>Marriage by elopement has been practiced, but marriage by capture
or by duel are not known. (See § <a href="#s82">82</a>.)</p>

<p>Nage, <i>quarreling and fighting</i>.&mdash;It used to be a custom among the
Omahas, when two men engaged in a fight, that he who gave the first
blow was beaten by the native policemen.</p>

<p>T´e¢ai, <i>accidental killing</i>, and "t´eki¢ai," <i>intentional killing</i> or <i>murder</i>,
are also crimes against religious law, which see in §§ <a href="#s310">310</a>, <a href="#s311">311</a>.</p>

<p><i>Witchcraft.</i>&mdash;When the supposed victim has died and the offender has
been detected his life may be taken by the kinsman of the victim without
a trial before the assembly or any other tribunal.</p>

<p><i>Slavery</i> was not known. Captives taken in war were not put to death.
(See § <a href="#s222">222</a>.)</p>

<p id="s301">§ 301. <span class="smcap">Social vices</span> (<i>a</i>), <i>Adultery</i>.&mdash;Sometimes a man steals another
man's wife. Sometimes he tempts her, but does not take her from her
husband. The injured man may strike or kill the guilty man, he may
hit the woman, or he may deprive the offending man of his property.
If a woman's husband be guilty of adultery with another woman she
may strike him or the guilty female in her anger, but she cannot claim
damages. In some extreme cases, as recorded by Say, an inexorable
man has been known to tie his frail partner firmly upon the earth in
the prairie, and in this situation has she been compelled to submit to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
the embraces of twenty or thirty men successively; she is then abandoned.
But this never happened when the woman had any immediate
kindred, for if she had any such kindred in the tribe the husband would
be afraid to punish his wife in that manner. A woman thus punished
became an outcast; no one would marry her.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Prostitution.</i>&mdash;In 1879 there were only two or three women in the
Omaha tribe that were known as mi<sup>n</sup>ckeda or public women. Of late
years, according to La Flèche and Two Crows, there have been many
mi<sup>n</sup>ckeda, but it was not so formerly, when the Indians were the only
inhabitants. A father did not reprove his daughter if she was a
mi<sup>n</sup>ckeda. He left that to her elder brother and her mother's brother,
who might strike her with sticks. Sometimes, if very angry with her,
they could shoot an arrow at her, and if they killed her, nobody could
complain.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Fornication.</i>&mdash;This is not practiced as a rule, except with women
or girls that are mi<sup>n</sup>ckeda. So strict are the Omahas about these matters,
that a young girl or even a married women walking or riding alone,
would be ruined in character, being liable to be taken for a mi<sup>n</sup>ckeda,
and addressed as such. No woman can ride or walk with any man but
her husband or some immediate kinsman. She generally gets some other
woman to accompany her, unless her husband goes. Young men are
forbidden to speak to girls, if they should meet two or more on the
road, unless they are kindred. The writer was told of some immorality
after some of the dances in which the women and girls participate.
This has occurred recently; and does not apply to all the females present,
but only to a few, and that not on all occasions. When girls go to
see the dances their mothers accompany them; and husbands go with
their wives. After the dance the women are taken home.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Schoopanism</i>. or <i>pæderastia</i>.&mdash;A man or boy who suffered as a victim
of this crime was called a mi<sup>n</sup>-quga, or hermaphrodite. La Flèche and
Two Crows say that the mi<sup>n</sup>-quga is "g¢a<sup>n</sup>¢i<sup>n</sup>," foolish, therefore he acts
in that manner.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Rape.</i>&mdash;But one Omaha has a bad reputation in the tribe for having
frequently been guilty of this crime. It is said that one day he met
the daughter of Gia<sup>n</sup>ze-¢iñge, when she was about a mile from home,
driving several ponies. He pulled her off her horse, and though she was
not over seven or eight years old, he violated her. The same man was
charged with having committed incest with his own mother.</p>

<p id="s302">§ 302. <i>Maiming.</i>&mdash;This never occurs except in two cases: First, by accident,
as when two men wrestle, in sport, and an arm is broken by a
blow from a bow or stick; secondly, when the policemen hit offenders
with their whips, on the head, arms, or body; but this is a punishment
and not a crime. La Flèche and Two Crows never heard of teeth
being knocked out, noses broken, eyes injured, etc., as among white or
colored men.</p>

<p><i>Slander</i> is not punishable, as it is like the wind, being "waniajĭ," that
is, unable to cause pain.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span></p>

<h3 id="PROPERTY_LAW">PROPERTY LAW.</h3>

<p id="s303">§ 303. Public property, provisions, and stock are not known. Hence,
there are no revenue laws.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Tribal property.</i>&mdash;Each tribe claimed a certain extent of territory
as its own, for purposes of occupancy, cultivation, hunting, and fishing.
But the right of a tribe to sell its land was something unheard of.
Portions of the Omaha territory were sold because the people feared to
refuse the white men. They consented just as a man would "consent"
to hand his purse to a highway robber who demanded his money or his
life. Land is enduring, even after the death of all of a generation of
Omahas; for the men of the next generation succeed and dwell on the
land. Land is like water and wind, "wé¢i<sup>n</sup>wi<sup>n</sup>-¢i`á-wá¢ě," <i>what cannot
be sold</i>. But horses, clothing, lodges, etc., soon perish, and these were
the only things that they could give away, being personal property.
The tribe had a common language, the right to engage together in the
chase as well as in war, and in certain rites of a religious and civil
character, which are described in connection with the hunting customs,
etc.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Gentile property.</i>&mdash;Each gens had its special "wewaspe," such as
the sacred pipes, chiefs, sacred tents, area in the tribal circle, etc. These
"wewaspe" also belonged, in a measure, to the whole tribe. (See Gentile
System, Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_III">III</a>.)</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Household property.</i>&mdash;This consisted of the right of occupancy of a
common dwelling, the right of each person to shares of fish, game, etc.,
acquired by any member of the household. When game was killed, it
belonged solely to the household of the slayer; members of any other
household had no right to take any part, but the slayer of a buffalo or
other large animal might give portions to those who aided him in cutting
it up. (See §§ <a href="#s147">147</a>, <a href="#s159">159</a>.)</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Personal property.</i>&mdash;When a father gave a horse or colt to his child,
the latter was the sole owner, and could do what he wished with the
property. Each head of a household held a possessory right to such a
tract or tracts of land as the members of his family or household cultivated;
and as long as the land was thus cultivated, his right to its enjoyment
was recognized by the rest of the tribe. But he could not sell
his part of the land. He also had a right to cultivate any unoccupied
land, and add it to his own. The husband and wife who were at the
head of the family or household, were the chief owners of the lodge,
robes, etc. They were joint owners, for when the man wished to give
away anything that could be spared he could not do so if his wife was
unwilling. So, too, if the wife wished to give away what could be
spared, she was unable to do it if her husband opposed her. Sometimes,
when the man gave something without consulting his wife, and told her
afterwards, she said nothing. The wife had control of all the food, and
the man consulted her before he invited guests to a feast saying: "Ewéku
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
ka<sup>n</sup>´b¢a. I<sup>n</sup>wi<sup>n</sup>´hañ-g&#259;." <i>i. e.</i>, "I wish to invite them to a feast. Boil
for me."</p>

<p>Members of the same tribe occasionally exchanged commodities. This
right was recognized by all. (See International Law, § <a href="#s307">307</a>.)</p>

<p id="s304">§ 304. <i>Debtors.</i>&mdash;When a man asked another to lend him anything, as
a knife, kettle, &amp;c., the owner would not refuse. When the borrower
had finished using it, he returned it to the lender, for he would be
ashamed to keep it as his own. There never was a case of refusal to
return a borrowed article. If the use of the thing had impaired its
value, the borrower always returned another article of the same kind,
which had to be in as good condition as the former was when it was
borrowed. There was no pay or interest on the loan. Sometimes,
when the borrower was a kinsman or friend of the lender, and he returned
to the latter his property, the lender would say to him, "Keep it!"</p>

<p id="s305">§ 305. <i>Order of inheritance.</i>&mdash;First, the eldest son, who becomes the
head of the household or family; then the other sons, who receive
shares from their brother; if there are sisters of these, they receive
from their eldest brother whatever he thinks that they should have.
Should the deceased leave no children, his kindred inherit in the following
order: His elder brother, younger brothers, sisters, mothers'
brothers, and sisters' sons. The widow receives nothing, unless she has
grown sons of her own, who can protect her. The husband's kindred
and the widow's step-sons generally deprive her of all the property,
because they fear lest she should go elsewhere and marry.</p>

<p id="s306">§ 306. <i>Crime against property law: Theft.</i>&mdash;When the suspected thief
did not confess his offense, some of his property was taken from him
until he told the truth. When he restored what he had stolen, one-half
of his own property was returned to him, and the rest was given to the
man from whom he had stolen. Sometimes all of the policemen whipped
the thief. But when the thief fled from the tribe, and remained away
for a year or two, the offense was not remembered on his return; so no
punishment ensued.</p>

<p>(See Societies, in Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_X">X</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="GOVERNMENT_LAW">GOVERNMENT LAW.</h3>

<p>(See the preceding chapter.) The crimes against government law
were violations of the rules of the buffalo hunt, quarreling, and fighting.
The violations of the rules of the buffalo hunt were also regarded
as crimes against religious law.

<p>(See War Customs, Military Law, and Visiting Customs.)</p>

<p id="s307">§ 307. <i>Mode of making peace with another tribe.</i>&mdash;When the Omahas
wished to make peace, which was termed, "making the land good," two
or more chiefs and some of the young men took one of the sacred pipes
and went unarmed towards the village or camp of the late foe, taking
care to go openly and in daylight, when their approach could be seen.
They were met by some of the villagers, who conducted them to a lodge,
where food was given them. After the meal, they were asked to tell
the object of their visit. The leader of the visitors then said, "I have
come because I think that we should fight no longer. I have come that
we may eat and smoke together." The principal man of the village
then replied, "It is good! If you tell the truth, when you come again,
we will give a horse to each one of you." At this time, no presents
were made by either party. They remained together two, three, or
four days, and left for home when their leader decided to depart. The
bearer of a peace pipe was generally respected by the enemy, just as
the bearer of a flag of truce is regarded by the laws of war among the
so-called civilized nations.</p>

<p>When strangers came to visit the Omahas, or when the latter visited
another tribe, presents were given by both parties, generally consisting
of horses and robes. But there was no commerce, as we understand
that term.</p>

<p>(See the preceding paragraphs, and War Customs.)</p>

<h3 id="RELIGIOUS_LAW">RELIGIOUS LAW.</h3>

<p id="s308">§ 308. The rules of the buffalo hunt, the consecration of the hearts
and tongues, the ceremonies pertaining to the anointing of the sacred
pole, etc., and those connected with the planting of the corn, were customs
which were regarded as laws received by their ancestors from
Wakanda; hence, they pertained to religion as well as to the government
of the tribe. (See §§ <a href="#s128">128</a>-<a href="#s163">163</a>.)</p>

<p id="s309">§ 309. The following are of a religious character: The worship of the
thunder, when first heard in the spring (§ <a href="#s24">24</a>), and when the men go to
war (§ <a href="#s196">196</a>); the style of wearing the hair in childhood (§ <a href="#s30">30</a>, etc.); most
of the governmental instrumentalities enumerated in Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">XI</a>, and
non-intercourse with a woman during her catamenial seclusion (§ <a href="#s97">97</a>).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>

<p>The Omahas were afraid to abandon their aged on the prairie when
away from their permanent villages lest Wakanda should punish them.</p>

<p>The most common offenses against religious law were murder and accidental
killing.</p>

<p id="s310">§ 310. <i>Murder.</i>&mdash;Murder of a fellow Omaha has been of rare occurrence.
Drunkenness alone has caused two men to kill each other in a
few cases; but owing to it there have been more instances of murder
and manslaughter. Before liquor was introduced there were no murders,
even when men quarreled. The murder of a fellow clansman was
unknown, except in a few cases of parricide, caused by drunkenness.
Parents never killed their children. About thirty-two years ago a man
killed his uncle to avenge the murder of another uncle by a drunken
son. Over sixty years ago a Ponka married an Omaha woman, and
remained with her tribe. His mother-in-law was a very bad old woman,
so he killed her. No Omaha ever killed an affinity.</p>

<p>Murder might be punished by taking the life of the murderer, or that
of one of his clansmen. When one man killed another, the kinsmen
of the murdered man wished to avenge his death, but the chiefs and
brave men usually interposed. Sometimes they showed one of the
sacred pipes; but they always took presents, and begged the kinsmen
to let the offender live. Sometimes the kinsmen of the murderer went
alone to meet the avengers; sometimes they took with them the chiefs
and brave men; sometimes the chiefs, braves, and generous men went
without the kinsmen of the murderer. Sometimes the avengers refused
to receive the presents, and killed the murderer. Even when
one of them was willing to receive them, it was in vain if the others
refused.</p>

<p>When the life of the murderer was spared, he was obliged to submit
to punishment from two to four years. He must walk barefoot. He
could eat no warm food; he could not raise his voice; nor could he look
around. He was compelled to pull his robe around him, and to have it
tied at the neck, even in warm weather; he could not let it hang loosely
or fly open. He could not move his hands about, but was obliged to
keep them close to his body. He could not comb his hair; and it must
not be blown about by the wind. He was obliged to pitch his tent about
a quarter of a mile from the rest of the tribe when they were going on
the hunt lest the ghost of his victim should raise a high wind, which
might cause damage. Only one of his kindred was allowed to remain
with him at his tent. No one wished to eat with him, for they said, "If
we eat with him whom Wakanda hates, for his crime, Wakanda will
hate us." Sometimes he wandered at night, crying and lamenting his
offense. At the end of the designated period, the kindred of the murdered
man heard his crying and said, "It is enough. Begone, and walk
among the crowd. Put on moccasins and wear a good robe." Should
a man get a bad reputation on account of being quarrelsome, his gens
might refuse to defend him. Even if the kindred were sad when he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
was slain, they would say nothing, and no one tried to avenge him. The
murder of a child was as great a crime as the murder of a chief, a brave,
or a woman. There was no distinction in the price to be paid.</p>

<p>Should the criminal escape to another tribe, and be absent for a year
or two, his crime would be remembered on his return, and he would be
in danger.</p>

<p id="s311">§ 311. <i>Accidental killing.</i>&mdash;When one man killed another accidentally,
he was rescued by the interposition of the chiefs, and subsequently was
punished as if he were a murderer, but only for a year or two.</p>

<p id="s312">§ 312. <i>Profanity.</i>&mdash;Cursing and swearing were unknown before the
white men introduced them. Not one of the ₵egiha dialects contains an
oath. The Omahas are very careful not to use names which they regard
as sacred on ordinary occasions; and no one dares to sing sacred
songs except the chiefs and old men at the proper times.</p>

<p id="s313">§ 313. <i>Drunkenness</i> became a crime, because it often led to murders;
so the Omaha policemen determined to punish each offender. Each one
of the ten gave him several blows with a whip, and the drunkard's
annuity for that year was taken from him. In 1854 this vice was broken
up, and since then there has been no instance of its occurrence among
the Omahas.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p id="s314">§ 314. <i>Falsehood.</i>&mdash;In 1879 Standing Hawk and a few others were
noted for this vice; but in 1882 La Flèche said that there were many
who had lost all regard for the truth. Formerly, only two or three were
notorious liars; but now, there are about twenty who do not lie. Scouts
were expected to speak the truth when they returned to report to the
directors, the keepers of the sacred tents, etc. (See §§ <a href="#s23">23</a>, <a href="#s136">136</a>, and <a href="#s137">137</a>.)
Warriors were obliged to undergo the ordeal of the wastegistu (Osage,
watse-ʞistu), before receiving the rewards of bravery. If one told a lie,
he was detected, as the Indians believed that the stick always fell from
the sacred bag in such a case. (See § <a href="#s214">214</a>.)</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES.</h2>

The writer was told by an Osage that Ma<sup>n</sup>ʇaqpa¢ě was at Fire Prairie, Missouri,
where the first treaty with the Osages was made by the United States. But that
place is on a creek of the same name, which empties into the Missouri River on the
south, in T. 50 N., R. 28 W., at the town of Napoleon, Jackson County, Missouri.
This could not have been the original Ma<sup>n</sup>ʇaqpa¢ě. Several local names have been
duplicated by the Kansas in the course of their wanderings, and there are traces of
similar duplications among the Osages. Besides this, the Omahas and Ponkas never
accompanied the Kansas and Osages beyond the mouth of the Osage River; and the
Kansas did not reach the neighborhood of Napoleon, Missouri, for some time after
the separation at the mouth of the Osage River.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">2</a>
A Ponka chief, Buffalo Chips, said that his tribe left the rest at White Earth
River and went as far as the Little Missouri River and the region of the Black Hills.
Finally, they returned to their kindred, who then began their journey down the
Missouri River. Other Ponkas have told about going to the Black Hills.</p></div>

Nikie names are those referring to a mythical ancestor, to some part of his body,
to some of his acts, or to some ancient rite which may have been established by him.
Nikie names are of several kinds, (<i>a.</i>) The seven birth names for each sex. (<i>b.</i>)
Other nikie names, not birth names, but peculiar to a single gens. (<i>c.</i>) Names
common to two or more gentes. There are two explanations of the last case. All
the gentes using the same name may have had a common mythical ancestor or a
mythical ancestor of the same species or genus. Among the Osages and Kansas
there are gentes that exchange names; and it is probable that the custom has existed
among the Omahas. Some of these gentes that exchange names are those
which have the same sacred songs.</p>

<p>The following law about nikie names has been observed by the Omahas:</p>

<p>There must never be more than one person in a gens bearing any particular male name.</p></div>

This agrees substantially with the Osage custom.</p></div>

These names are found in the corresponding Ponka gens, the Wajaje or Osage, a

Many names have been omitted because an exact translation could not be given,
though the references to certain animals or mythical ancestors are apparent. It is
the wish of the writer to publish hereafter a comparative list of personal names of
the cognate tribes, Omahas, Ponkas, Osages, Kansas, and Kwapas, for which considerable
material has been collected.</p></div>

Frank La Flèche said that he had seen three heads of wajïñga[p]a on one pipe, and
that the number varied from one to six. There was no part of the neck of the bird,
and the lower mandible was removed. In this respect only the above figure does not
represent the <i>Omaha</i> pipe.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">10</a>
This is the regular Omaha style. The above figure shows the Dakota style.
One of this kind was given to Frank La Flèche by an Omaha to whom he had given
a horse.</p></div>

The hañge ʞi`a<sup>n</sup>ze for the child in the calumet dance differs somewhat from that
used by the chiefs and other adults. In the former the stripes next the mouth are
wanting, and, instead, is painted the stripe down the nose.</p></div>

These directors were not necessarily Iñke-sabě men. The wacabe and pipe were
always abandoned when the people were about to return home. The order of ceremonies
varied. Sometimes the sacred pole was anointed after the first herd of buffaloes
had been surrounded. In that case the abandonment of the wacabe and pipe
was postponed awhile. Sometimes they were abandoned before the pole was
anointed; and sometimes they were retained till the end of the Hede-watci. They
were abandoned during the day. The pipe was fastened across the middle of the
wacabe, which was stuck into the ground on a hill.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">13</a>
The Osages have an account of the origin of corn, etc., in one of their sacred songs
preserved in their secret society. They do not allow their young men to learn these
songs. The writer has an abstract of this account obtained from one of the Osage
chiefs. It takes four days or nights to tell or chant the tradition of any Osage gens.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">14</a>
None of the questions answered by Frank La Flèche were asked by the writer
while Joseph La Flèche and Two Crows were in Washington; it was not till he heard
Miss Fletcher's article on the Dakota sun-dance that it occurred to him that similar
customs might have been practiced by the Omahas in this Hede-watci.</p></div>

This word "ujeʇi" appears to be the Dakota "otceti," <i>fire-place</i>, expressed in
Omaha notation. As the household fire-place is in the center of the lodge, so the
tribal fire-place was in the center of the tribal circle.</p></div>

Frank Fa Flèche said that the two pipes used in the Hede-watci were the weawa<sup>n</sup>,
from which the ducks' heads were removed, and instead of them were put on the red
pipe bowls of the sacred pipes. (See § <a href="#s30">30</a>.)</p></div>
